We're all here, to praise the words of the excellent God
He deserves the excellent praise, so lift it up with a right mind.
In order to give him glory and mercy.
Oh, sing with me.

Oh, Lord.
How excellent.
How excellent.
How excellent.
How excellent.

Is... thy name

Oh, Lord.
How excellent.
How excellent.
How excellent.
How excellent.

Is... thy name
In all the earth

Jesus, excellent
Is... thy name
In all the earth

Every knee shall bow
and every tongue confess
that he is Lord

Jesus, excellent
Jesus, excellent
Jesus, excellent
Is thy name
