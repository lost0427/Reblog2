to our Savior, Jesus, worthy of all praise.

Jesus, worthy of all praise.
 

99
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:12,498
It is good to live the name of the Lord our God.
 

100
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:16,700
It is right to give Him thanks and praise.
 

101
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,361
For His heart is overflowing with love for us
 

102
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,563
and His mercy we can never contain.
 

103
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:30,287
It is good to live the name of the Lord our God.
 

104
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:33,868
It is right to give Him thanks and praise.
 

105
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:36,470
For His heart Hallelujah!
 

106
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,029
Hallelujah!
 

107
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,490
Hallelujah!
 

108
00:09:38,490 --> 00:10:06,466
As we prepare Just to sing the next chorus
 

109
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:10,109
I was sharing with the 9 o'clock service
 

110
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,152
the women were going to be starting a small group series
 

111
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:18,755
from the book,
 

112
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:21,018
The Exciting New Life by Andrew Murray.
 

113
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:25,181
Highly recommended by the leadership of this church.
 

114
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:26,842
It's like going to Bible school
 

115
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:28,063
if you just read through that book.
 

116
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:31,346
And I've been going through it.
 

117
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:34,769
And I stopped on a chapter
 

118
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,090
and I was sharing it
 

119
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,471
up at the Sanctus Young Adults Retreat this weekend.
 

120
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:40,572
My husband and I were there.
 

121
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,653
And it's this idea of
 

122
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:45,913
we're just singing, right?
 

123
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:49,416
For his heart, God's heart
 

124
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,956
is overflowing with love for us.
 

125
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:55,706
His heart is overflowing.
 

126
00:10:55,706 --> 00:10:58,248
We're not coming into God's presence saying
 

127
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:00,008
please pay attention to me.
 

128
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:01,849
Please be interested in my life.
 

129
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:04,168
Please care about what I'm going through.
 

130
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:06,669
We're worshiping today because we're able to sing.
 

131
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:10,471
His heart is overflowing with love for us.
 

132
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:14,552
And his mercy we can never contain.
 

133
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:16,332
Think about that.
 

134
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:17,952
His mercy.
 

135
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:19,833
How many of us need mercy today?
 

136
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:25,250
This is the truth of God's word and who Jesus is.
 

137
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,393
We could never contain the mercy
 

138
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:31,695
that is offered to us through Jesus Christ.
 

139
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:33,956
And so there's this particular chapter in the book
 

140
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:38,259
that talks about the surrender of Christ to the believer.
 

141
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:39,581
And what I love about the book is
 

142
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:40,520
it doesn't start
 

143
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,744
with all the things that we need to do as Christians.
 

144
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:46,664
And really none of the book is about that.
 

145
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:51,206
It's more about everything that Jesus has done for us.
 

146
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:54,149
and will do in and through us as we look to him
 

147
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,009
as we depend on him.
 

148
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,731
And so the chapter is called The Surrender of Christ
 

149
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:00,092
and it just talks about
 

150
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,817
and it just blew me away, you know, for whatever reason
 

151
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:08,058
that's the chapter I just kept pondering and meditating on
 

152
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:12,701
that Christ has surrendered himself to us.
 

153
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:15,283
He's given himself.
 

154
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,975
Jesus Christ, King of Kings, Lord of Lords,
 

155
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:21,336
the Alpha and the Omega
 

156
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:24,399
the beginning and the end, has surrendered himself.
 

157
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:24,940
And that's why
 

158
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,224
verses throughout the New Testament talk about
 

159
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:32,269
for he so loved the church that Christ gave himself.
 

160
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:37,404
There are countless verses throughout the New Testament
 

161
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,466
that use that phrase over and over again
 

162
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:42,106
that Jesus has given himself.
 

163
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:44,727
He surrendered himself on a cross
 

164
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:49,489
because of his incredible, passionate love.
 

165
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:52,211
For us, he surrendered himself.
 

166
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:56,592
He came from heaven and surrendered his own life so
 

167
00:12:56,592 --> 00:13:00,355
that we could be restored into relationship with him.
 

168
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:03,537
And now that the barrier of sin has been removed
 

169
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:06,278
and there's nothing standing in between us.
 

170
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:08,019
and intimacy with the Father
 

171
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,261
who is the source of everything that we need today.
 

172
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:13,823
I don't care what your need is today.
 

173
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:16,686
I don't care what you brought in here today.
 

174
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:18,006
Jesus is the answer.
 

175
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:22,010
You were made for him, by him, to glorify him
 

176
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,493
to be fulfilled by him alone.
 

177
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:26,514
That's what heaven will be.
 

178
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,498
Finally, to be in his presence
 

179
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:32,644
and nothing to be in the way, no sin, no physical body,
 

180
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:35,227
just in the presence of Jesus
 

181
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:38,013
and fully fulfilled and satisfied by him alone.
 

182
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,993
He wants us to experience that here on earth
 

183
00:13:42,993 --> 00:13:45,796
and the Bible says it would be from glory to glory
 

184
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:47,116
to glory to come
 

185
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:49,740
and experience and know what this means
 

186
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,222
that Christ has given himself to you.
 

187
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:55,765
What have we done to deserve that?
 

188
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,147
Nothing.
 

189
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:59,649
But he has given himself, and he says
 

190
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:01,091
everything that I am now.
 

191
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:06,298
is yours everything that i am i have surrendered
 

192
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:11,539
what an incredible word i have surrendered myself to you so
 

193
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:14,880
that you would lack nothing today you are not alone
 

194
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,581
today you have jesus
 

195
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:21,442
and everything that he is you are his heir today
 

196
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:25,303
and he is yours everything that he has in yours so
 

197
00:14:25,303 --> 00:14:26,764
whatever your need is today
 

198
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:30,130
don't be downcast Jesus is the answer
 

199
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,601
and he is yours completely if you put your faith in him.
 

200
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:36,243
He is yours completely.
 

201
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,604
He gives himself to you today.
 

202
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:42,066
And he just wants you to learn how to receive all that he
 

203
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:42,527
is.
 

204
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:45,347
The fullness of life that he gives us
 

205
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:47,009
because of what he did on the cross.
 

206
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:48,490
And it's through that
 

207
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,030
that then we come into worship.
 

208
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,893
Not this obligatory thing of now I've got to worship.
 

209
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,413
It's the right thing to do.
 

210
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:58,375
But we love him because he first loved us.
 

211
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,577
And now in response to a God who would give himself for us.
 

212
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:06,600
who held nothing back but surrenders himself to us.
 

213
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,360
Now, it's out of love
 

214
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,562
it's out of gratitude
 

215
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:12,003
that we give our lives back to him and say
 

216
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:13,563
now take all of me.
 

217
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:15,065
You've given me all of you
 

218
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:17,166
so now here is all of me, God.
 

219
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,386
Here's my heart.
 

220
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:19,687
Here's my life.
 

221
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,149
Here's my worship.
 

222
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:23,950
I put no idols before me, Jesus.
 

223
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,051
You are my God.
 

224
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:26,010
You are my King.
 

225
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,552
You are my Savior.
 

226
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,153
You are my everything.
 

227
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:31,654
And I give you the highest praise today.
 

228
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:32,715
Amen?
 

229
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:33,316

232

everything that he is to you today.

349
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:56,369
and to you are all things.
 

350
00:28:56,369 --> 00:29:00,752
You deserve the glory.
 

351
00:29:00,752 --> 00:29:03,394
One more time, let the church sing to the Lord.
 

352
00:29:03,394 --> 00:29:10,720
You are worthy of it all.
 

353
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,981
You are worthy of it all.
 

354
00:29:22,537 --> 00:29:37,980
Amen.
 

355
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,921
I'd like to share something with you.
 

356
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:40,980
Give God glory.
 

357
00:29:42,442 --> 00:29:43,741
About three days ago
 

358
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:46,863
I was busy ministering in different places this past week.
 

359
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:53,355
Around Thursday, I started to get
 

360
00:29:53,355 --> 00:29:55,180
some severe pains in my head.
 

361
00:29:56,222 --> 00:29:58,086
And even to the touch
 

362
00:29:58,086 --> 00:29:59,371
my wife got alarmed because...
 

363
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:02,536
It was very weird.
 

364
00:30:02,536 --> 00:30:05,118
I couldn't lay in the pillow the right way.
 

365
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:09,422
And my left eye just was not functioning right.
 

366
00:30:09,422 --> 00:30:10,323
And there was pain.
 

367
00:30:10,323 --> 00:30:11,944
I didn't know what it was.
 

368
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:13,345
And I'm the type that, ah
 

369
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:14,546
it'll get better tomorrow.
 

370
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,588
But it didn't get better tomorrow.
 

371
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:17,589
So it was really bad.
 

372
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:24,875
And so I was alone last night praying with my Bible open
 

373
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:28,138
and wanting to get something to feed you with today.
 

374
00:30:29,469 --> 00:30:32,009
And it was bothering me.
 

375
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:33,150
So I went to bed.
 

376
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,930
And when I laid on the pillow
 

377
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,210
I was having pain.
 

378
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,571
I don't think I'm a complainer
 

379
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:43,491
but I was experiencing pain.
 

380
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:44,852
So I tried to sleep through it.
 

381
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:45,952
About three in the morning
 

382
00:30:45,952 --> 00:30:46,812
I got up again.
 

383
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,052
And I said, no
 

384
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:49,792
the Lord's woken me up for something.
 

385
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:53,873
So I went out of the bedroom to talk with the Lord.
 

386
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:56,674
And I said to the Lord, Lord
 

387
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:59,014
I can't do what you want me to do tomorrow.
 

388
00:31:00,017 --> 00:31:04,100
Unless you heal me because I can't function this way.
 

389
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,960
I can't do this.
 

390
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:08,102
And there was no one to pray for me.
 

391
00:31:08,102 --> 00:31:10,144
But when there's no one around to pray for you
 

392
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:11,485
you just pray for yourself.
 

393
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:11,905
Amen.
 

394
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:18,029
So my head in most places was sensitive to the touch.
 

395
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:22,552
And I just prayed, called on the Lord, prayed for a while,
 

396
00:31:22,552 --> 00:31:24,733
went back to bed, drifted off to sleep,
 

397
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:25,734
got up this morning and.
 

398
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:31,014
I was a little bit sideways, I think, even this morning.
 

399
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,336
But I came to the church
 

400
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:34,778
and I was sitting in my office alone.
 

401
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:37,661
And suddenly, as I was worshiping the Lord
 

402
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:41,525
I felt like God just touched me.
 

403
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,626
And I touched my head.
 

404
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:44,347
There was no pain.
 

405
00:31:44,347 --> 00:31:45,368
I felt my eye.
 

406
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:47,290
There was no pain.
 

407
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,551
So I have no pain.
 

408
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:49,973
And we thank God for no pain.
 

409
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:59,874
Jesus is alive and he can still heal.
 

410
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,383
I am the Lord that healeth thee.
 

411
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:23,832
I am the Lord your healer.
 

412
00:32:23,832 --> 00:32:26,074
I send my word
 

413
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:34,001
and if you need healing come on up to the front right now
 

414
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,746

415
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:39,448
come down here to the front
 

416
00:32:39,448 --> 00:33:06,117

I am the Lord your healer.
 

418
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:13,443
Come on, sing out loud.
 

419
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:14,304
Everyone sing.
 

420
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:23,411
I am the Lord that healeth thee.
 

421
00:33:24,492 --> 00:33:36,028
I am the Lord I am the Lord your healer I send my word
 

422
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:46,333

423
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,134
Lift up your hands here in the front.
 

424
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:49,194
Lift them to the Lord.
 

425
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:55,177
I am the Lord that healeth thee
 

426
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:08,012
I sent my word and healed your disease.

I sent my word and healed your disease.
 

429
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:20,615
I am the Lord your healer.
 

430
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:30,697
I am the Lord that healeth thee.
 

431
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:40,342
I am the Lord your healer.
 

432
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:46,044
I send my word in courtesy.
 

433
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:53,597
I am the Lord.
 

434
00:34:53,597 --> 00:34:56,038
Keep moving, choir members, and pray.
 

435
00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:59,899
I am the Lord.
 

436
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:05,562
Sing congregation.
 

437
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:09,283
I am the Lord.
 

438
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:36,419
Call on the Lord.
 

439
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:37,319
Call on the Lord.
 

440
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:41,822
Master Brian, quick.
 

441
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:51,514
Call on the Lord.
 

442
00:35:51,514 --> 00:35:52,034
Trust him.
 

443
00:35:57,802 --> 00:36:01,267
Jesus, we thank you today for how you've reminded us.
 

444
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:03,029
You've given us everything.
 

445
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:05,332
You've held no good thing from us.
 

446
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:07,908
And as you walked among us
 

447
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:08,468
one of the ways
 

448
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:10,890
that you expressed all that you had longed to give
 

449
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,011
is a healing touch.
 

450
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:15,133
In so many ways and so many examples through the Gospels,
 

451
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:15,333
Lord
 

452
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,355
we have these accounts of how as you walked among us
 

453
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:19,556
you opened blind eyes
 

454
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:21,998
you brought healing to the infirm God.
 

455
00:36:21,998 --> 00:36:23,539
And we thank you that you haven't changed
 

456
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:26,004
that you're the same today as you've always been.
 

457
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:28,087
And we thank you that on the cross you paid a price
 

458
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:30,510
that allowed whatever the obstructions would be
 

459
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,973
to stand in the way of your grace
 

460
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:35,176
and your love being made alive in us.
 

461
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:38,481
God, we thank you that by stripes, your stripes
 

462
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:39,682
we find healing today.
 

463
00:36:40,904 --> 00:36:41,004
Amen.
 

464
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:41,104
Amen.
 

465
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,482
That there is a Savior who still cares
 

466
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:12,384
and is able to meet the needs of people
 

467
00:37:12,384 --> 00:37:14,506
as they look to Him and trust Him for it.
 

468
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:17,549
God, give them hope today as you touch them.
 

469
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:19,171
We have hope in you, God.
 

470
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:19,951
We trust you.
 

471
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:21,873
But God, confirm, Lord
 

472
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,856
in our hearts today just how alive you are
 

473
00:37:24,856 --> 00:37:28,199
and how you see and how you want to move and touch.
 

474
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,320
Make your grace alive.
 

475
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,121
Make it real.
 

476
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:31,142
Even now we pray.
 

477
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:33,803
That Jesus would be glorified.
 

478
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:36,966
That we would know blessing, God, to become a blessing.
 

479
00:37:36,966 --> 00:37:40,389
That through that, Jesus would be lifted up and glorified.
 

480
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:41,350
Touch the people here.
 

481
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,152
Touch the people online.
 

482
00:37:43,152 --> 00:37:44,493
For your glory, we pray.
 

483
00:37:44,493 --> 00:37:47,116
It's in Jesus' name we all ask and sing.
 

484
00:37:47,116 --> 00:37:48,257
Amen.
 

485
00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:54,063
Stay where you are.
 

486
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,264
Choir, come back quick.
 

487
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:04,963
Let's solidify Pastor Brian's prayer.
 

488
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:06,384
Everybody lift up one hand.
 

489
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:10,725
We're going to sing that word of God one more time, okay?
 

490
00:38:10,725 --> 00:38:23,670
I am the Lord, that healeth thee.
 

491
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:30,333
I am the Lord, your healer.
 

492
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:40,373
I accept my word and heal your disease.
 

493
00:38:41,554 --> 00:38:48,780
I am the Lord, your healer.
 

494
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,141
And Lord, we pray that
 

495
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:51,903
surgeries will be canceled
 

496
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:57,207
in the mighty name of Jesus Christ
 

497
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,670
for his honor and glory.
 

498
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,459
And everyone said, Yeah.
 

499
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:34,612
Hallelujah, glory to be praised!
 

500
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:39,436

Hallelujah, glory to be praised.

Hallelujah, glory to be praised.
 

505
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:20,390
I lift my hands.
 

506
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:28,158
I lift my hands
 

507
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:30,800
I praise you Lord.
 

508
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,244
I bow my head
 

509
00:40:35,244 --> 00:40:37,145
I honor you Lord.
 

510
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:50,693
Hallelujah, glory to the brave
 

511
00:40:50,693 --> 00:40:55,734

I honor you, Lord.
 

516
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:25,375
I lift my hands.

I praise you, Lord.
 

518
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:31,718
I bow my head.
 

519
00:41:31,718 --> 00:41:35,180
I honor you, Lord.
 

520
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,941
Hallelujah.
 

521
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:40,668
Go over to me, praise.
 

522
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:46,672
Hallelujah, God wants you to be praised.
 

523
00:41:47,913 --> 00:41:52,076
Hallelujah, God wants you to be praised.
 

524
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:30,208
Hallelujah, you're worthy.
 

525
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:34,229
Hallelujah, we praise and hate.
 

526
00:42:34,229 --> 00:42:36,949
Hallelujah, so worthy.
 

527
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:39,750
Hallelujah, Lord, we lift you up.
 

528
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,790
Hallelujah, you're worthy.
 

529
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:45,108
Alleluia, we praise your name.
 

530
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:47,851
Alleluia, it's over.
 

531
00:42:47,851 --> 00:42:48,432
Alleluia.
 

532
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,753
Alleluia.
 

533
00:42:49,753 --> 00:42:50,433
Alleluia.
 

534
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:51,434
Alleluia.
 

535
00:43:15,879 --> 00:43:21,064
Hallelujah, we praise your name.
 

536
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:23,306
Hallelujah, so worthy.
 

537
00:43:40,222 --> 00:43:43,344
Hallelujah, Lord we lift you up.
 

538
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:46,466
Hallelujah, you're worthy.
 

539
00:43:46,466 --> 00:43:50,529
Hallelujah, we praise your name.
 

540
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:53,311
Hallelujah, you're so worthy.
 

541
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:56,073
Hallelujah, Lord we lift you up.
 

542
00:43:56,073 --> 00:43:59,235
Hallelujah, you're worthy.
 

543
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:02,417
Hallelujah, we praise your name.
 

544
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:04,539
Hallelujah, you're so worthy.
 

545
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:09,647
Hallelujah, Lord we lift you up Hallelujah
 

546
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,768
you're worthy Hallelujah
 

547
00:44:12,768 --> 00:44:19,451
we praise your name Hallelujah, so worthy Hallelujah
 

548
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:24,433
Lord we lift you up Lord we lift you up
 

549
00:44:25,813 --> 00:44:30,515
Lord we lift you up Lord we lift you up
 

550
00:45:08,852 --> 00:45:17,096
I lift my hands in total adoration unto you.
 

551
00:45:18,636 --> 00:45:23,038
You reign on the throne.
 

552
00:45:23,038 --> 00:45:27,800
For you are God and God alone.
 

553
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,642
Because of you my cloudy days are gone.
 

554
00:45:33,882 --> 00:45:37,184
I can sing to you this song.
 

555
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:46,111
I just wanna say that I love you more than anything
 

556
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:57,434
I lift my hands in total adoration unto you
 

557
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:04,936
You reign on the throne For you are God
 

558
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:12,593
and God alone Because of you my cloudy days are gone.
 

559
00:46:13,894 --> 00:46:18,296
I can sing to you this song.
 

560
00:46:18,296 --> 00:46:19,937
I just want to say
 

561
00:46:19,937 --> 00:46:26,601
that I love you more than anything.
 

562
00:46:29,443 --> 00:46:33,083
Hold me in your arms.
 

563
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:38,686
You were my shelter from the storm
 

564
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:48,851
When all my friends were gone You were right there all along
 

565
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:59,979
I've never known a love like this before I just want to say
 

566
00:46:59,979 --> 00:47:06,984
that I love you more than anything.
 

567
00:47:10,186 --> 00:47:12,588
I love you, Jesus.
 

568
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,974
I worship and adore you.
 

569
00:47:19,974 --> 00:47:24,334
Just want to tell you Lord
 

570
00:47:24,334 --> 00:47:31,117
I love you more than anything.
 

571
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:37,580
I love you, Jesus.
 

572
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:44,963
I worship and adore you.
 

573
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:47,304
Just want to tell you.
 

574
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:56,909
Lord, I love you more than anything.
 

575
00:47:56,909 --> 00:48:04,212
I love you, Jesus.
 

576
00:48:05,212 --> 00:48:09,954
I worship and adore.
 

577
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:12,355
Just want to tell you.
 

578
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:22,407
Lord, I love you more than any.
 

579
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,489
I love you, Jesus.
 

580
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:34,912
I worship and adore you.
 

581
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,333
Just want to tell you.
 

582
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:52,561
I love you, Jesus.
 

583
00:48:55,143 --> 00:48:58,046
I worship and adore you.
 

584
00:48:58,046 --> 00:48:59,267
Just want to tell you, Lord
 

585
00:48:59,267 --> 00:49:02,349
I love you more than anything.
 

586
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,471
I love you, Jesus.
 

587
00:49:50,151 --> 00:49:54,917
I worship and adore you.
 

588
00:49:54,917 --> 00:49:57,400
Just want to tell you.
 

589
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:03,948
Oh, I love you more than anything.
 

590
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:30,260
Thank you.
 

591
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:08,732
I was lost in my sin
 

592
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:14,673
when he found me Broken
 

593
00:51:14,673 --> 00:51:25,615
and in despair Desperately searching for something
 

594
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:28,736
For someone who
 

595
00:51:34,693 --> 00:51:48,180
Then I met Christ the Savior Who gave His life for me
 

596
00:51:50,302 --> 00:51:54,884
Overwhelmed by His mercy
 

597
00:51:56,265 --> 00:52:10,613
And all He's done for me Forgive me.
 

598
00:52:10,613 --> 00:52:22,285
My life has changed since Jesus came and loved me.
 

599
00:52:22,285 --> 00:52:25,428
Forgive me.
 

600
00:52:25,428 --> 00:52:28,091
I know I'm new.
 

601
00:52:33,932 --> 00:52:41,098
Now I see.
 

602
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:48,625
Now I believe.
 

603
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:56,431
Now I know His love for me.
 

604
00:53:02,998 --> 00:53:12,426
When I think of how far I have wandered Wounded
 

605
00:53:12,426 --> 00:53:21,153
and filled with shame I stand amazed
 

606
00:53:21,153 --> 00:53:30,761
that He loved me Before I called on His name
 

607
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:38,115
I had heard of the love of Jesus.
 

608
00:53:39,176 --> 00:53:46,221
Oh, but I never thought it could be
 

609
00:53:46,221 --> 00:53:58,709
that He would show so much mercy and save someone like me.
 

610
00:54:01,682 --> 00:54:07,967
He loved me, forgave me.
 

611
00:54:07,967 --> 00:54:15,713
My life has changed since Jesus came.
 

612
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:21,877
And He loved me, forgave me.
 

613
00:54:21,877 --> 00:54:35,545
I know I'll never be I see, now I believe.
 

614
00:54:35,545 --> 00:54:36,846
Now, I know His love for me.
 

615
00:54:36,846 --> 00:54:37,866
I know His love for me.
 

616
00:55:03,395 --> 00:55:06,317
he loved me forgave me my life has changed he loved me
 

617
00:55:06,317 --> 00:55:08,398
and loved me and he forgave me my life
 

618
00:56:34,255 --> 00:56:36,196
Stay for a second, choir.
 

619
00:56:37,657 --> 00:56:42,981
We want to do as we did earlier today, have a prayer.
 

620
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:49,586
I'm going to ask Didi if, step forward, Brother Didi
 

621
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:50,647
and he's going to pray.
 

622
00:56:50,647 --> 00:56:54,849
We have two things going on that I want you to know about.
 

623
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:59,933
Number one is tomorrow, about 284 children ages 9 through 13
 

624
00:57:03,555 --> 00:57:05,936
leave the church on buses
 

625
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:11,900
and they go up to the largest BT Kids retreat we've ever had
 

626
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,041
and it's the longest.
 

627
00:57:14,061 --> 00:57:19,745
It's from Monday through the Sunday, I think.
 

628
00:57:19,745 --> 00:57:23,147
Yeah, they get back on Saturday, Sunday.
 

629
00:57:23,147 --> 00:57:28,190
So there's 284 of these little ones, young people
 

630
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:33,535
and a good number of them are not part of the church.
 

631
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:38,178
They're not regular attendees at the BT Kids.
 

632
00:57:38,178 --> 00:57:39,979
So they're unchurched.
 

633
00:57:39,979 --> 00:57:41,881
We don't know what they know about the Lord.
 

634
00:57:43,442 --> 00:57:44,402
But that's perfect.
 

635
00:57:44,402 --> 00:57:44,743
Amen.
 

636
00:57:44,743 --> 00:57:47,745
They're going to learn about Jesus up at that camp.
 

637
00:57:47,745 --> 00:57:51,427
And that's a great age to get them, 9 through 13.
 

638
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:54,829
So also, they understand
 

639
00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:56,871
there'll be some behavioral problems
 

640
00:57:56,871 --> 00:57:59,212
or special needs situations.
 

641
00:57:59,212 --> 00:58:01,494
So we need the counselors.
 

642
00:58:02,686 --> 00:58:05,929
And Miss Amy, who's up there.
 

643
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:07,970
And all the workers up there.
 

644
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:12,174
They need a special anointing of the Holy Spirit on them.
 

645
00:58:12,174 --> 00:58:14,936
Do you agree with me?
 

646
00:58:14,936 --> 00:58:17,478
Because we've got to see a breakthrough for these children.
 

647
00:58:17,478 --> 00:58:19,039
Got to see it.
 

648
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:20,540
Got to see it.
 

649
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,721
So we're going to pray for that.
 

650
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:23,042
Didi's going to lead us.
 

651
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:24,958
The second thing is...
 

652
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:26,358
On Wednesday of this week
 

653
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:30,779
you join with me on Tuesday for our prayer meeting, please.
 

654
00:58:30,779 --> 00:58:33,340
I invite you to come.
 

655
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,241
I'll be here and we'll seek the Lord together, worship.
 

656
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:42,402
But on Wednesday, a representative group of the choir
 

657
00:58:42,402 --> 00:58:44,082
is going to be getting on an airplane
 

658
00:58:44,082 --> 00:58:49,103
and traveling through Atlanta to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
 

659
00:58:49,103 --> 00:58:51,044
And from there, about a half hour, 40 minutes.
 

660
00:58:52,713 --> 00:58:56,676
to the prison at Louisiana State Penitentiary.
 

661
00:58:56,676 --> 00:58:58,658
It's called Angola.
 

662
00:58:58,658 --> 00:59:01,060
For those of you visiting, the average sentence
 

663
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,042
this is the most serious prison.
 

664
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:07,346
It was the most infamous prison in America decades ago.
 

665
00:59:07,346 --> 00:59:10,969
God's done something there, but 5,200 inmates.
 

666
00:59:10,969 --> 00:59:13,331
It's as big as the island of Manhattan
 

667
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:15,953
and the average sentence is 91 years.
 

668
00:59:17,334 --> 00:59:23,213
You have sex offenders in there with 300-year sentences
 

669
00:59:24,234 --> 00:59:28,158
and death row where guys are appealing.
 

670
00:59:28,158 --> 00:59:30,740
And they're going there for two concerts
 

671
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,143
and I'm going to preach the gospel after each one.
 

672
00:59:34,143 --> 00:59:37,987
God's made it all possible through donation.
 

673
00:59:37,987 --> 00:59:41,050
Listen, I had lunch with the person who wanted to go,
 

674
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:41,990
who told me
 

675
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,192
I heard you want to go to Angola.
 

676
00:59:44,192 --> 00:59:47,495
We got an invitation from a more receptive...
 

677
00:59:48,609 --> 00:59:49,490
How can I say it?
 

678
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:52,414
Warden, the first warden that we worked with,
 

679
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:53,816
our dear, dear friend.
 

680
00:59:53,816 --> 00:59:56,079
But he moved on to Mississippi.
 

681
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,441
And then the other warden
 

682
00:59:57,441 --> 01:00:00,806
didn't want so much of this Jesus stuff happening there.
 

683
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:03,930
And now there's a new warden who God has healed.
 

684
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:05,968
He came close to death.
 

685
01:00:05,968 --> 01:00:07,289
And he talked to me on the phone.
 

686
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:09,590
I can't wait to see him, my friend.
 

687
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,351
And he told me, listen, pastor
 

688
01:00:11,351 --> 01:00:12,412
when you see me
 

689
01:00:12,412 --> 01:00:14,353
I'm a living miracle.
 

690
01:00:14,353 --> 01:00:16,014
God brought me back from the dead.
 

691
01:00:17,134 --> 01:00:20,196
That'll get Jesus in your life real quick, right?
 

692
01:00:20,196 --> 01:00:21,256
And in the prison.
 

693
01:00:21,256 --> 01:00:24,078
So he's very hospitable.
 

694
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,279
He's looking forward to it.
 

695
01:00:26,279 --> 01:00:27,780
I shared that with the man.
 

696
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,461
What a blessing God is.
 

697
01:00:29,461 --> 01:00:32,383
He said, what's it going to cost to move all those people?
 

698
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:35,396
Airfares, hotels, food, the whole thing.
 

699
01:00:35,396 --> 01:00:37,036
I gave him a round number
 

700
01:00:37,036 --> 01:00:39,137
which I had checked into
 

701
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:41,517
and he just took out a checkbook, and he wrote
 

702
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:43,098
and he paid for the whole thing.
 

703
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,018
Can we thank God?
 

704
01:00:44,018 --> 01:00:46,959
Come on, can we thank God for the open door
 

705
01:00:46,959 --> 01:00:50,079
and then the money that's been supplied?
 

706
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:56,040
So, Dini's going to pray also that the choir is anointed
 

707
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,107
that God gives me the right words to say.
 

708
01:00:59,107 --> 01:01:00,849
We're going to visit also
 

709
01:01:00,849 --> 01:01:03,473
not everyone can come to these two concerts.
 

710
01:01:03,473 --> 01:01:07,899
Some guys are locked up because of behavioral trouble.
 

711
01:01:07,899 --> 01:01:09,722
They're in Camp J.
 

712
01:01:09,722 --> 01:01:12,446
They don't get out of their cell but one hour a day.
 

713
01:01:12,446 --> 01:01:15,262
And then there's dozens and dozens of guys.
 

714
01:01:15,262 --> 01:01:16,844
who are on death row
 

715
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:19,206
and we're going to go visit them.
 

716
01:01:19,206 --> 01:01:22,269
And, you know, I was telling someone today
 

717
01:01:22,269 --> 01:01:23,851
you just go from cell to cell.
 

718
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:25,332
It's beautiful ministry.
 

719
01:01:25,332 --> 01:01:26,474
You go from cell to cell.
 

720
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,535
Here's a cell.
 

721
01:01:27,535 --> 01:01:28,376
And I look in
 

722
01:01:28,376 --> 01:01:33,601
and the guy's in his shorts sitting on the cot
 

723
01:01:33,601 --> 01:01:34,562
and he looks at me
 

724
01:01:34,562 --> 01:01:35,443
and he gets up.
 

725
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:36,484
That means he wants to talk.
 

726
01:01:37,492 --> 01:01:38,972
And he walks and he goes, who are you?
 

727
01:01:38,972 --> 01:01:41,773
I tell him, we start to talk, pray with him.
 

728
01:01:41,773 --> 01:01:43,893
I go to the next cell after a while.
 

729
01:01:43,893 --> 01:01:45,674
If that guy just goes like that
 

730
01:01:45,674 --> 01:01:47,854
that means he doesn't want to talk.
 

731
01:01:47,854 --> 01:01:48,955
I go to the next cell.
 

732
01:01:49,995 --> 01:01:52,595
I just keep telling people about Jesus.
 

733
01:01:52,595 --> 01:01:54,076
They're going to sing about Jesus.
 

734
01:01:54,076 --> 01:01:55,736
I'm going to talk about Jesus.
 

735
01:01:55,736 --> 01:01:59,097
But without the power of the Holy Spirit helping us
 

736
01:01:59,097 --> 01:02:02,057
it's just words, palabras.
 

737
01:02:02,057 --> 01:02:03,978
We need poder, power.
 

738
01:02:03,978 --> 01:02:04,238
Amen?
 

739
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,209
Would you bow your head and pray?
 

740
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:07,949
Didi, pray.
 

741
01:02:09,009 --> 01:02:11,811
So, Father God, we come to you this afternoon
 

742
01:02:13,031 --> 01:02:15,232
humble before you, God.
 

743
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:16,693
We humble ourselves before you.
 

744
01:02:17,713 --> 01:02:23,216
We stand here accepted, forgiven, loved by you, God
 

745
01:02:23,216 --> 01:02:25,637
with a love that surpasses all understanding.
 

746
01:02:26,837 --> 01:02:28,298
So, God, as we stand before you
 

747
01:02:28,298 --> 01:02:29,298
we ask for your help.
 

748
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:31,619
With the kids, God
 

749
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:34,441
that are going to retreat, Father
 

750
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:37,356
we pray As Moses said
 

751
01:02:37,356 --> 01:02:38,777
if you don't go with us
 

752
01:02:38,777 --> 01:02:39,617
we will not go.
 

753
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:44,419
So Lord, I pray that you will equip the leaders.
 

754
01:02:44,419 --> 01:02:45,979
We are empty vessels.
 

755
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:47,820
We want you to fill us with your spirit.
 

756
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,361
That the words of our mouth
 

757
01:02:50,361 --> 01:02:54,562
the meditations of our heart will be acceptable to you, God.
 

758
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,043
May you fill us with your spirit, God.
 

759
01:02:57,043 --> 01:03:00,064
I pray that these keys that will encounter your love
 

760
01:03:00,064 --> 01:03:01,064
even as Paul said
 

761
01:03:01,064 --> 01:03:02,184
that it will know you
 

762
01:03:02,184 --> 01:03:04,565
and the power of your resurrection.
 

763
01:03:04,565 --> 01:03:07,027
And the power of your love, God.
 

764
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:08,128
And I thank you, God
 

765
01:03:08,128 --> 01:03:09,949
even as I stand here
 

766
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:13,852
my testimony of knowing you at a very, very young age.
 

767
01:03:15,013 --> 01:03:19,035
I pray that these kids will also have a testimony, God.
 

768
01:03:19,035 --> 01:03:20,937
That they will know you, God.
 

769
01:03:20,937 --> 01:03:23,619
That you will keep them from harm, God.
 

770
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:24,920
That you will protect them
 

771
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:28,302
and that you will put your hands on each one of them, God.
 

772
01:03:28,302 --> 01:03:29,847
We thank you, Father.
 

773
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,688
Lord, we also pray for the choir
 

774
01:03:31,688 --> 01:03:32,929
that's calling to the prison,
 

775
01:03:32,929 --> 01:03:33,189
God,
 

776
01:03:33,189 --> 01:03:35,571
and even for Pastor God.
 

777
01:03:35,571 --> 01:03:39,433
We pray, God, that you will give them the ability
 

778
01:03:39,433 --> 01:03:41,134
to articulate,
 

779
01:03:41,134 --> 01:03:42,415
even with the songs
 

780
01:03:42,415 --> 01:03:43,175
and the preaching,
 

781
01:03:43,175 --> 01:03:47,418
God, the many troubles that this man and this woman
 

782
01:03:47,418 --> 01:03:47,898
go through,
 

783
01:03:47,898 --> 01:03:48,198
God.
 

784
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:52,421
I pray that your power will go with them.
 

785
01:03:52,421 --> 01:03:54,702
I pray that your spirit will go with them.
 

786
01:03:54,702 --> 01:03:57,937
Even I pray that you will go before them, God.
 

787
01:03:57,937 --> 01:03:59,198
Even before they get there
 

788
01:03:59,198 --> 01:04:00,498
you will be there, God.
 

789
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:03,839
You will be there preparing the heart of God,
 

790
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,680
breaking ground for the gospel to penetrate the heart.
 

791
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:09,601
For you have come, God
 

792
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:12,242
to give us life and life abundantly.
 

793
01:04:12,242 --> 01:04:15,624
May this be the gift from them as well, God.
 

794
01:04:15,624 --> 01:04:17,404
We thank you and we love you.
 

795
01:04:17,404 --> 01:04:19,385
In Jesus' mighty name we pray.
 

796
01:04:19,385 --> 01:04:20,085
Amen.
 

797
01:04:20,085 --> 01:04:20,786
Amen.
 

798
01:04:20,786 --> 01:04:22,086
Amen.
 

799
01:04:22,086 --> 01:04:22,626
Thank you.
 

800
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:24,767
Thank you, my brother.
 

801
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,240
Bye-bye choir.
 

802
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:27,721
Thank you.
 

803
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:28,241
Great work.
 

804
01:04:29,441 --> 01:04:32,142
Let's hear for the choir so they know we appreciate them.
 

805
01:04:33,823 --> 01:04:35,024
God is good, isn't he?
 

806
01:04:35,024 --> 01:04:38,485
He keeps, you know
 

807
01:04:38,485 --> 01:04:39,626
my wife's over here.
 

808
01:04:41,106 --> 01:04:42,407
She wrote that last song.
 

809
01:04:42,407 --> 01:04:43,987
That's one of my favorite songs.
 

810
01:04:43,987 --> 01:04:45,108
He loved me.
 

811
01:04:45,108 --> 01:04:46,108
Do you like that song?
 

812
01:04:46,108 --> 01:04:49,230
He loved me, forgave me.
 

813
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:53,171
My life has changed since Jesus came and loved me.
 

814
01:04:53,171 --> 01:04:55,535
So I was thinking
 

815
01:04:55,535 --> 01:04:57,556
You see this front row here
 

816
01:04:57,556 --> 01:04:59,938
and then the row behind it.
 

817
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:01,939
Those two rows of people.
 

818
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:05,482
That was the entire congregation on a good day
 

819
01:05:05,482 --> 01:05:06,462
when we first came.
 

820
01:05:07,763 --> 01:05:10,425
That row and the row behind.
 

821
01:05:10,425 --> 01:05:13,948
And the auditorium was not as big as the lobby
 

822
01:05:13,948 --> 01:05:15,589
over here on Smith Street.
 

823
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,611
And boy, I was thinking about it,
 

824
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:22,734
talking with pastors in another state this week.
 

825
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:25,194
Boy, it was...
 

826
01:05:25,194 --> 01:05:26,415
We didn't know what to expect.
 

827
01:05:26,415 --> 01:05:30,017
It was hard at times, fighting discouragement.
 

828
01:05:30,017 --> 01:05:32,119
But look how good the Lord has done.
 

829
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:36,462
And I want you to know from my wife and I and the pastors
 

830
01:05:36,462 --> 01:05:37,402
I know you're going to think, oh
 

831
01:05:37,402 --> 01:05:38,523
you're being melodramatic.
 

832
01:05:39,824 --> 01:05:42,566
As God is listening, we love you.
 

833
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:45,388
We love you.
 

834
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:48,189
Hold steady, please.
 

835
01:05:48,189 --> 01:05:49,630
We love you.
 

836
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:53,233
And we thank God for you.
 

837
01:05:54,365 --> 01:05:57,568
And I tell, Elaine happens to be helping me today.
 

838
01:05:57,568 --> 01:05:58,709
I'll turn to her and say
 

839
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:02,071
this is the sweetest group of people in the entire world.
 

840
01:06:03,432 --> 01:06:04,173
And it is.
 

841
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:05,514
We have our, you know
 

842
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:08,676
irregulars like any church has.
 

843
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:13,200
But the way you worship God
 

844
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,101
the way you pray
 

845
01:06:14,101 --> 01:06:16,482
I just sometimes sit over here and weep.
 

846
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:21,126
Because I think of all the days when there was no music
 

847
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:24,040
while my wife was always Excellent on the keyboard
 

848
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,361
but God has done a good thing.
 

849
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:27,262
How about in your life?
 

850
01:06:27,262 --> 01:06:28,423
You ever look back?
 

851
01:06:28,423 --> 01:06:31,345
How many, wait, how many look back on your life?
 

852
01:06:31,345 --> 01:06:33,846
God has brought you a very long way.
 

853
01:06:33,846 --> 01:06:34,847
Wave your hand at me.
 

854
01:06:34,847 --> 01:06:37,009
It took you a long, long way.
 

855
01:06:38,009 --> 01:06:40,411
Over mountains you didn't think you'd get over
 

856
01:06:40,411 --> 01:06:43,173
through valleys that seem so long.
 

857
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:49,997
Would you please remember to share in your giving online?
 

858
01:06:49,997 --> 01:06:52,743
Those of you online, please help us.
 

859
01:06:52,743 --> 01:06:56,065
And then there's a physical offering taken as you leave.
 

860
01:06:56,065 --> 01:06:57,966
But please, don't be a non-giver.
 

861
01:06:59,426 --> 01:07:06,470
And I say this, you know, if you
 

862
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:08,791
how can I say this?
 

863
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:14,754
You should give and tithe to the church that you go to
 

864
01:07:14,754 --> 01:07:15,494
and you're a member.
 

865
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,356
Pay your bill at the restaurant where you ate.
 

866
01:07:21,178 --> 01:07:23,580
If you eat a Chick-fil-A and they say, okay
 

867
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,820
give me your credit card.
 

868
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,341
Oh, no, I'm going to pay a junior store
 

869
01:07:26,341 --> 01:07:28,082
in downtown Brooklyn.
 

870
01:07:28,082 --> 01:07:30,344
Try that out and see how it works, okay?
 

871
01:07:31,744 --> 01:07:33,886
And I say that to our own detriment.
 

872
01:07:33,886 --> 01:07:35,747
If you're a member of another church
 

873
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:36,888
you should be giving there.
 

874
01:07:36,888 --> 01:07:38,629
But if you come here
 

875
01:07:38,629 --> 01:07:40,810
you feel led to give to another church somewhere
 

876
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:42,231
where you used to live,
 

877
01:07:42,231 --> 01:07:42,771
praise God
 

878
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:43,812
do as you feel led.
 

879
01:07:43,812 --> 01:07:46,853
But that's not the way the church is sustained.
 

880
01:07:46,853 --> 01:07:50,100
We should be faithful in the place where God put us.
 

881
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,081
Did I say that with sensitivity?
 

882
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:53,741
I want you to know that.
 

883
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:55,121
That's important.
 

884
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:56,822
That's important.
 

885
01:07:56,822 --> 01:08:00,083
And it helps us pay the bills.
 

886
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:04,344
And we got some big, big bills coming up soon.
 

887
01:08:04,344 --> 01:08:07,865
We have to change our whole computer system.
 

888
01:08:07,865 --> 01:08:10,125
I can't even explain it.
 

889
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:13,406
And since we've been here 20-some years now,
 

890
01:08:14,807 --> 01:08:19,163
our whole HVAC system heating, air conditioning
 

891
01:08:19,163 --> 01:08:20,904
the brain that works it
 

892
01:08:20,904 --> 01:08:23,146
everything has to be fixed.
 

893
01:08:24,627 --> 01:08:25,627
You know what that means?
 

894
01:08:27,048 --> 01:08:28,049
Mucho dinero.
 

895
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:29,710
Comprende?
 

896
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:30,470
No comprende?
 

897
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:32,671
Mucho dinero.
 

898
01:08:34,392 --> 01:08:35,873
And where is that?
 

899
01:08:35,873 --> 01:08:37,995
God's going to supply everything.
 

900
01:08:37,995 --> 01:08:39,235
God's going to supply.
 

901
01:08:39,235 --> 01:08:42,077
Let's clap that God supplies everything we need.
 

902
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:46,740
Your phone?
 

903
01:08:49,253 --> 01:08:51,634
So if you gave
 

904
01:08:51,634 --> 01:08:53,215
I want to introduce my message.
 

905
01:08:56,016 --> 01:08:57,857
If you gave this smartphone
 

906
01:08:57,857 --> 01:09:02,580
, this cell phone to someone from Siberia in northern Russia
 

907
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:05,481
who had never used a cell phone
 

908
01:09:05,481 --> 01:09:08,002
or some remote tribe in the South Pacific
 

909
01:09:08,002 --> 01:09:10,284
or just someplace where there's no phones.
 

910
01:09:10,284 --> 01:09:11,584
Thank you, Jeffrey.
 

911
01:09:11,584 --> 01:09:15,006
Jeffrey, he is some keyboard player.
 

912
01:09:15,006 --> 01:09:17,327
Do you hear what that guy is doing over there?
 

913
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:18,668
Thank you, Jeffrey.
 

914
01:09:20,444 --> 01:09:23,827
so if you gave this phone to someone
 

915
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,330
and said here's how you make a call
 

916
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:29,973
it's your phone now it's yours so they make a call
 

917
01:09:29,973 --> 01:09:32,455
so now you come back three days later
 

918
01:09:32,455 --> 01:09:36,659
and you see in their room there's papers everywhere
 

919
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:39,141
there's cds there's all this stuff
 

920
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:41,243
and you go how'd you enjoy the phone
 

921
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:41,524
well
 

922
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:41,804
yeah
 

923
01:09:41,804 --> 01:09:43,345
good i call the family member
 

924
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:46,308
and all of that what's all the paper with the numbers on it
 

925
01:09:47,482 --> 01:09:50,284
Oh, I had to do some adding, subtracting.
 

926
01:09:50,284 --> 01:09:54,567
I had to check on banking stuff.
 

927
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:56,708
What is 10% of this and that?
 

928
01:09:58,189 --> 01:09:59,790
And then Elaine would say, no
 

929
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:02,331
you didn't need to write that out.
 

930
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,212
The phone does it.
 

931
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:08,095
You go to utilities or whatever and you hit it
 

932
01:10:08,095 --> 01:10:10,076
and now you have adding, subtraction,
 

933
01:10:10,076 --> 01:10:14,079
division and multiplication.
 

934
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:15,117
No.
 

935
01:10:15,117 --> 01:10:19,540
Yeah, you wasted hours figuring out all that math stuff.
 

936
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,121
You didn't have to do that.
 

937
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:23,083
And what's the camera with all that film
 

938
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:24,544
that you bought at the drugstore?
 

939
01:10:25,885 --> 01:10:26,465
Oh, I need it.
 

940
01:10:26,465 --> 01:10:27,546
I want to take pictures.
 

941
01:10:27,546 --> 01:10:29,747
No, you can take pictures with this.
 

942
01:10:29,747 --> 01:10:31,629
No, it's a phone.
 

943
01:10:31,629 --> 01:10:33,890
No, no, it's a new kind of phone.
 

944
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:40,695
And she got a picture of her children
 

945
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:42,236
or grandchildren or somebody.
 

946
01:10:44,915 --> 01:10:47,716
Someone, you know, you don't buy music.
 

947
01:10:47,716 --> 01:10:49,917
You download it on your phone.
 

948
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:50,277
What?
 

949
01:10:50,277 --> 01:10:51,838
I can hear music on this thing?
 

950
01:10:51,838 --> 01:10:53,879
Yeah, you can do a lot of things.
 

951
01:10:55,979 --> 01:10:59,001
And all those trips that you went to the store to buy
 

952
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:01,602
there's something called Amazon Prime.
 

953
01:11:01,602 --> 01:11:05,423
Oh, that rang a bell.
 

954
01:11:05,423 --> 01:11:07,564
How many know about Amazon Prime?
 

955
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:09,545
Oh, yeah.
 

956
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:11,566
Those boxes are flying around.
 

957
01:11:13,787 --> 01:11:14,527
Are you kidding?
 

958
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:17,110
I had all of that
 

959
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:18,911
and I didn't know how to use it.
 

960
01:11:18,911 --> 01:11:22,252
And I wasted hours, hours, money, all kinds of things.
 

961
01:11:23,573 --> 01:11:24,573
I took my car.
 

962
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:25,334
I went shopping.
 

963
01:11:25,334 --> 01:11:26,374
I got a ticket.
 

964
01:11:26,374 --> 01:11:28,035
That's going to cost me extra.
 

965
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:29,875
You mean I could have just got this
 

966
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:30,916
and when would they send it?
 

967
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,156
Like in a week or two?
 

968
01:11:32,156 --> 01:11:32,856
No, next day.
 

969
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:34,297
Am I right?
 

970
01:11:35,637 --> 01:11:37,758
Someone told me you get it same day.
 

971
01:11:37,758 --> 01:11:37,998
True?
 

972
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:45,041
So, you know, being a Christian many times is like this.
 

973
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:49,604
We have everything that God promised we would need,
 

974
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:50,684
and then some
 

975
01:11:50,684 --> 01:11:52,986
beyond what we could ask or think.
 

976
01:11:52,986 --> 01:11:59,051
But if we don't know we have it, we're adding, subtracting
 

977
01:11:59,051 --> 01:12:01,213
we're doing all these primitive things.
 

978
01:12:01,213 --> 01:12:02,393
Thank you.
 

979
01:12:02,393 --> 01:12:04,515
We do all these things
 

980
01:12:04,515 --> 01:12:05,556
and we don't know.
 

981
01:12:05,556 --> 01:12:07,357
No, when you're a Christian
 

982
01:12:07,357 --> 01:12:08,918
you have everything you need.
 

983
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,481
You know, we sang that chorus a few weeks ago.
 

984
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:15,764
He is all I need.
 

985
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:16,690
Sing it.
 

986
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:21,012
He is all I need.
 

987
01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:22,372
Keep going.
 

988
01:12:22,372 --> 01:12:30,435
Jesus is all I need.
 

989
01:12:30,435 --> 01:12:31,476
Keep going.
 

990
01:12:31,476 --> 01:12:37,918
He is all I need.
 

991
01:12:43,232 --> 01:12:51,578
Jesus is all I need.
 

992
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:55,961
Now, when Jesus was here on earth
 

993
01:12:55,961 --> 01:12:59,704
when it got time for him to give his life on the cross
 

994
01:12:59,704 --> 01:13:01,565
he started telling the disciples
 

995
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,827
I'm going to send someone to help you.
 

996
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:06,969
I'm leaving, but I'm sending another helper.
 

997
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:09,150
I'll be gone.
 

998
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,371
I'll be seated in heaven.
 

999
01:13:10,371 --> 01:13:13,732
I'm not coming back until I come back.
 

1000
01:13:13,732 --> 01:13:17,433
But you'll have someone working in you.
 

1001
01:13:17,433 --> 01:13:19,094
I've only been able to be with you.
 

1002
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:20,835
He was in a physical body.
 

1003
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:21,715
So if I was here
 

1004
01:13:21,715 --> 01:13:22,855
Jesus could be there.
 

1005
01:13:22,855 --> 01:13:25,036
Peter could be here, Jesus there.
 

1006
01:13:25,036 --> 01:13:27,097
But he said when the Holy Spirit comes
 

1007
01:13:27,097 --> 01:13:28,617
he'll be in you.
 

1008
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:34,419
Many people learn to appreciate
 

1009
01:13:34,419 --> 01:13:36,320
as Christians the ministry of Jesus
 

1010
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,641
and what he did on the cross.
 

1011
01:13:37,641 --> 01:13:41,815
But they're not so clear and a little fuzzy.
 

1012
01:13:41,815 --> 01:13:44,776
on why the Holy Spirit is so important.
 

1013
01:13:44,776 --> 01:13:47,297
Especially when you realize this
 

1014
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:50,299
the only thing God can do on earth
 

1015
01:13:50,299 --> 01:13:51,819
everything he does on earth,
 

1016
01:13:51,819 --> 01:13:54,240
has to be accomplished through the Holy Spirit.
 

1017
01:13:56,441 --> 01:13:57,622
To the degree that you
 

1018
01:13:57,622 --> 01:14:00,983
and I and this church experience the Holy Spirit
 

1019
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:04,144
that's what we'll be able to know of God and do for God.
 

1020
01:14:05,605 --> 01:14:10,247
Because there's no option B. It's Holy Spirit or bust.
 

1021
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,896
So my wife and I have been talking a lot lately.
 

1022
01:14:15,896 --> 01:14:17,617
In some churches, they grow up.
 

1023
01:14:17,617 --> 01:14:20,318
Some of you possibly visiting have grown up.
 

1024
01:14:20,318 --> 01:14:22,459
No emphasis on the Holy Spirit.
 

1025
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:23,180
No mention,
 

1026
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,501
even though it's all throughout the New Testament.
 

1027
01:14:25,501 --> 01:14:29,523
And the Holy Spirit is identified with wildfire
 

1028
01:14:29,523 --> 01:14:33,104
and crazy stuff going on in certain kinds of churches.
 

1029
01:14:33,104 --> 01:14:36,546
So you write it off and you say, oh, that's wildfire.
 

1030
01:14:37,687 --> 01:14:41,868
Then on the other side, there is wildfire.
 

1031
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:43,479
So it's a morgue.
 

1032
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,840
or it's an insane asylum.
 

1033
01:14:46,662 --> 01:14:48,063
It's a cemetery
 

1034
01:14:48,063 --> 01:14:49,644
or they're bouncing off the walls
 

1035
01:14:49,644 --> 01:14:52,226
doing things that are not even mentioned in the Bible.
 

1036
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:56,669
So today I want to give you
 

1037
01:14:56,669 --> 01:14:58,751
because last week we talked about
 

1038
01:14:58,751 --> 01:15:00,993
how the Holy Spirit helps you get through
 

1039
01:15:00,993 --> 01:15:02,874
when the going gets tough
 

1040
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:02,874
.
 

1041
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:04,496
I want to tell you right now
 

1042
01:15:04,496 --> 01:15:06,057
about some other things
 

1043
01:15:06,057 --> 01:15:09,079
the wonderful Holy Spirit has promised to do for us.
 

1044
01:15:09,079 --> 01:15:10,140
But like the phone
 

1045
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,301
if you don't know it
 

1046
01:15:11,301 --> 01:15:13,400
you won't avail yourself of it.
 

1047
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,061
So Jesus talked about it
 

1048
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:19,043
and now Paul writes about it in Romans chapter 8,
 

1049
01:15:20,143 --> 01:15:23,105
and he says, you, Christians in Rome,
 

1050
01:15:23,105 --> 01:15:25,646
however, are not in the realm of the flesh.
 

1051
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:29,989
You used to live just obeying the impulses of the flesh.
 

1052
01:15:31,009 --> 01:15:34,571
Drink, drugs, sex, money,
 

1053
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:38,993
lying, hate, kill, racial prejudice,
 

1054
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,354
whatever, whatever.
 

1055
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,141
It ignited you.
 

1056
01:15:44,141 --> 01:15:45,702
That's how you lived.
 

1057
01:15:45,702 --> 01:15:50,305
But now you are in the realm of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit.
 

1058
01:15:50,305 --> 01:15:55,368
If indeed the Spirit of God lives in you, in you.
 

1059
01:15:56,609 --> 01:15:59,971
And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ
 

1060
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:02,772
they do not belong to Christ.
 

1061
01:16:02,772 --> 01:16:04,454
So everybody here listen now
 

1062
01:16:04,454 --> 01:16:07,996
because I want to clear conscience when I sleep tonight.
 

1063
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,076
You have to know this.
 

1064
01:16:10,697 --> 01:16:12,083
In the early church
 

1065
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:13,064
And until this day
 

1066
01:16:14,425 --> 01:16:16,347
the way you can tell a Christian
 

1067
01:16:16,347 --> 01:16:18,208
and the only way you know a Christian
 

1068
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:20,930
is they have the Holy Spirit living inside of them.
 

1069
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:23,212
They've been born again.
 

1070
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:24,954
They have a new life.
 

1071
01:16:24,954 --> 01:16:26,215
Not go to church.
 

1072
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:27,275
Not a member of a church.
 

1073
01:16:27,275 --> 01:16:28,496
Not own a Bible.
 

1074
01:16:28,496 --> 01:16:30,358
Not believe in the man upstairs.
 

1075
01:16:30,358 --> 01:16:31,739
Not try to live a good life.
 

1076
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:33,060
That does not make you a Christian.
 

1077
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:37,003
You must, Jesus said, be born again.
 

1078
01:16:37,003 --> 01:16:38,264
How many are with me so far?
 

1079
01:16:38,264 --> 01:16:39,848
Say amen.
 

1080
01:16:39,848 --> 01:16:43,531
And that Spirit of Christ that comes and lives inside of us,
 

1081
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:44,552
Paul says
 

1082
01:16:44,552 --> 01:16:46,293
if anyone doesn't have that
 

1083
01:16:46,293 --> 01:16:47,874
they're not a Christian.
 

1084
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:49,775
I know, but they try to live a good life.
 

1085
01:16:49,775 --> 01:16:51,737
I know, but they're not a Christian.
 

1086
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:53,138
A Christian is supernatural.
 

1087
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:57,001
You've either had that supernatural experience
 

1088
01:16:57,001 --> 01:16:57,661
or you haven't.
 

1089
01:16:59,102 --> 01:17:01,384
And it's our job here to encourage you
 

1090
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:03,906
if you have not been born again
 

1091
01:17:03,906 --> 01:17:06,548
it doesn't just confess your sins
 

1092
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:08,930
and throw yourself on the mercy of god
 

1093
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,832
and receive christ and what he did on the cross
 

1094
01:17:11,832 --> 01:17:13,914
okay so the holy spirit is given
 

1095
01:17:13,914 --> 01:17:16,856
and we're the temples of the holy spirit
 

1096
01:17:16,856 --> 01:17:18,597
each one of us individually
 

1097
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:20,919
that'd be refreshing
 

1098
01:17:20,919 --> 01:17:26,563
tomorrow wake up the holy spirit lives within me
 

1099
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:30,406
inside everything i say
 

1100
01:17:30,406 --> 01:17:34,918
he's going to hear Anything I watch
 

1101
01:17:34,918 --> 01:17:36,779
he's going to have to look at it with me.
 

1102
01:17:41,099 --> 01:17:42,220
Every place I go
 

1103
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,060
I drag him into that place.
 

1104
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:46,660
Probably be a life changer.
 

1105
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:47,541
How many say amen?
 

1106
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:50,461
But if you're not conscious of that
 

1107
01:17:50,461 --> 01:17:53,802
you have you here and God over there.
 

1108
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:54,642
And once in a while
 

1109
01:17:54,642 --> 01:17:56,402
he might visit you in a meeting.
 

1110
01:17:56,402 --> 01:17:57,922
But that's not so.
 

1111
01:17:57,922 --> 01:17:59,403
He lives inside of all of us.
 

1112
01:18:01,383 --> 01:18:01,703
Why?
 

1113
01:18:01,703 --> 01:18:02,350
Why?
 

1114
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,331
Well, one of the great reasons
 

1115
01:18:04,331 --> 01:18:07,413
why we learn later on in that chapter
 

1116
01:18:07,413 --> 01:18:07,413
,
 

1117
01:18:07,413 --> 01:18:08,333
it says
 

1118
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:11,595
for those who are led by the Spirit of God
 

1119
01:18:11,595 --> 01:18:12,916
are the children of God.
 

1120
01:18:14,397 --> 01:18:17,979
The Spirit you receive, the Holy Spirit
 

1121
01:18:17,979 --> 01:18:19,840
does not make you slaves
 

1122
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,181
like you were to sin, driven, compulsive.
 

1123
01:18:23,181 --> 01:18:25,683
You had to do it so
 

1124
01:18:25,683 --> 01:18:27,124
that you live in fear again.
 

1125
01:18:27,124 --> 01:18:30,478
Rather, The Spirit you receive
 

1126
01:18:30,478 --> 01:18:33,599
brought about your adoption to sonship,
 

1127
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:39,520
and by him, by the Spirit, we cry, Abba, Father, Father.
 

1128
01:18:43,241 --> 01:18:45,842
The Spirit, Holy Spirit himself
 

1129
01:18:45,842 --> 01:18:49,783
testifies with our inner human spirit
 

1130
01:18:49,783 --> 01:18:51,863
that we are God's children.
 

1131
01:18:51,863 --> 01:18:53,884
So here's number one reason
 

1132
01:18:53,884 --> 01:18:56,713
one of the reasons God gave us the Holy Spirit
 

1133
01:18:56,713 --> 01:19:01,055
is the Holy Spirit lives within me and testifies
 

1134
01:19:01,055 --> 01:19:03,256
assures my human spirit
 

1135
01:19:03,256 --> 01:19:05,257
you are not what you used to be.
 

1136
01:19:05,257 --> 01:19:06,677
You are a new creation.
 

1137
01:19:07,858 --> 01:19:11,780
And that spirit bears witness with our human spirit.
 

1138
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,300
We're not what we want to be.
 

1139
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,141
We're not what we should be.
 

1140
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:17,322
But how many know without a shadow of a doubt
 

1141
01:19:17,322 --> 01:19:19,043
you are not what you used to be?
 

1142
01:19:19,043 --> 01:19:20,843
Lift your hand.
 

1143
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:21,824
Why do we know that?
 

1144
01:19:21,824 --> 01:19:24,505
The spirit bears witness with our spirit.
 

1145
01:19:25,569 --> 01:19:27,410
We are children of God.
 

1146
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,892
When we pray, we're not praying to some foreign God.
 

1147
01:19:29,892 --> 01:19:33,234
We're praying, Father, Father, Abba, Father
 

1148
01:19:33,234 --> 01:19:36,316
which is another way of saying Father, Father, Father.
 

1149
01:19:40,078 --> 01:19:42,720
Satan will attack and say
 

1150
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,321
you're not a believer of this.
 

1151
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,662
He'll condemn you.
 

1152
01:19:45,662 --> 01:19:48,764
But the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit.
 

1153
01:19:48,764 --> 01:19:51,406
You are a child of God.
 

1154
01:19:53,007 --> 01:19:54,608
You're in the family of God.
 

1155
01:19:55,658 --> 01:19:57,419
I am in the family of God.
 

1156
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,441
The Holy Spirit lives inside of me
 

1157
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:02,962
and tells me no matter what failings I have
 

1158
01:20:02,962 --> 01:20:04,783
and where I mess up
 

1159
01:20:04,783 --> 01:20:06,324
I am a child of God.
 

1160
01:20:06,324 --> 01:20:07,845
How many know without a shadow of a doubt
 

1161
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,106
you are a child of God?
 

1162
01:20:09,106 --> 01:20:11,047
Wave your hand at me, come on.
 

1163
01:20:11,047 --> 01:20:16,150
Not churchgoer, not just churchgoer, but a child of God.
 

1164
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,171
The Spirit bears witness.
 

1165
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,002
The scripture goes on further
 

1166
01:20:21,002 --> 01:20:22,723
that he that is joined to the Lord
 

1167
01:20:22,723 --> 01:20:24,624
is one spirit with the Lord.
 

1168
01:20:24,624 --> 01:20:27,325
Paul talks about that in 2 Corinthians.
 

1169
01:20:27,325 --> 01:20:31,047
So the merging is the spirit of God
 

1170
01:20:31,047 --> 01:20:33,349
merges with my human spirit.
 

1171
01:20:33,349 --> 01:20:35,850
And now I'm that new creation.
 

1172
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:38,011
I'm not the old Jim Cimbala.
 

1173
01:20:38,011 --> 01:20:39,532
You're not the old you.
 

1174
01:20:39,532 --> 01:20:41,213
You're a new you.
 

1175
01:20:41,213 --> 01:20:42,914
Because Christ is in you.
 

1176
01:20:42,914 --> 01:20:44,335
How is Christ in you?
 

1177
01:20:44,335 --> 01:20:46,196
Through the presence of the Holy Spirit.
 

1178
01:20:47,436 --> 01:20:47,977
Comprende?
 

1179
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:48,597
No comprende.
 

1180
01:20:49,671 --> 01:20:53,694
So now, notice why it's so important
 

1181
01:20:53,694 --> 01:20:55,956
the Holy Spirit lives within us.
 

1182
01:20:55,956 --> 01:20:57,177
Well, it's like this.
 

1183
01:20:58,258 --> 01:20:59,679
In the Old Testament
 

1184
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:01,040
we had the law.
 

1185
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,683
We had Moses and we had commands given by God
 

1186
01:21:04,683 --> 01:21:06,364
etched on stone.
 

1187
01:21:06,364 --> 01:21:08,306
And that revealed God's holiness.
 

1188
01:21:08,306 --> 01:21:09,287
Don't kill.
 

1189
01:21:09,287 --> 01:21:10,768
Don't commit adultery.
 

1190
01:21:10,768 --> 01:21:11,709
Don't lie.
 

1191
01:21:11,709 --> 01:21:12,409
Don't steal.
 

1192
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,610
Don't bear false witness.
 

1193
01:21:14,951 --> 01:21:16,352
Honor your mother and father
 

1194
01:21:16,352 --> 01:21:17,893
and so on and so forth.
 

1195
01:21:17,893 --> 01:21:20,034
So that was those commands.
 

1196
01:21:20,034 --> 01:21:23,057
The only trouble was they were written on stone
 

1197
01:21:23,057 --> 01:21:24,678
and my problem is not stone.
 

1198
01:21:24,678 --> 01:21:27,920
My problem is my heart, my mind.
 

1199
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,081
How many are like me, right?
 

1200
01:21:29,081 --> 01:21:31,442
To agree with my head.
 

1201
01:21:31,442 --> 01:21:32,843
Oh, yeah, that's true.
 

1202
01:21:32,843 --> 01:21:34,004
That's the way I should live.
 

1203
01:21:34,004 --> 01:21:34,945
But how are you going to do it?
 

1204
01:21:34,945 --> 01:21:36,686
How are you going to do it?
 

1205
01:21:38,247 --> 01:21:41,369
So that was the old covenant.
 

1206
01:21:41,369 --> 01:21:45,312
Now the promises started to come in the Old Testament
 

1207
01:21:45,312 --> 01:21:47,193
that one day Messiah would come.
 

1208
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,102
And Messiah would be the deliverer.
 

1209
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:56,406
He would be that ideal son of God, son of man.
 

1210
01:21:56,406 --> 01:22:00,669
He would be the answer to Israel's problems.
 

1211
01:22:00,669 --> 01:22:05,072
So everyone was waiting for Messiah, serious Jews.
 

1212
01:22:05,072 --> 01:22:06,373
When will Messiah come?
 

1213
01:22:07,494 --> 01:22:08,595
Rachel had a baby.
 

1214
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:11,056
I wonder if that's Messiah.
 

1215
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:12,618
There's a preacher out there.
 

1216
01:22:12,618 --> 01:22:13,518
Is he Messiah?
 

1217
01:22:13,518 --> 01:22:16,040
Oh, there's a guy called John the Baptist.
 

1218
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,711
Maybe he's the Messiah. was waiting for Messiah.
 

1219
01:22:21,152 --> 01:22:23,073
And the Bible tells us in detail
 

1220
01:22:23,073 --> 01:22:25,855
that Messiah would be born in Bethlehem
 

1221
01:22:25,855 --> 01:22:27,356
in the book of Micah.
 

1222
01:22:27,356 --> 01:22:29,237
It tells us he would be ripped
 

1223
01:22:29,237 --> 01:22:31,438
and torn apart on a cross.
 

1224
01:22:31,438 --> 01:22:33,400
It tells us they would pluck out his beard.
 

1225
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,642
They would beat him so bad he wouldn't be recognizable
 

1226
01:22:37,642 --> 01:22:39,163
and so on and so forth.
 

1227
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:41,785
But along with those promises about Messiah
 

1228
01:22:41,785 --> 01:22:43,486
there were other promises
 

1229
01:22:43,486 --> 01:22:47,148
about something else coming from God.
 

1230
01:22:47,148 --> 01:22:53,010
And that was the Spirit of God giving us a whole new inside
 

1231
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,731
a whole new person
 

1232
01:22:54,731 --> 01:22:56,351
like I've been saying.
 

1233
01:22:56,351 --> 01:23:00,252
So Ezekiel was one who prophesied the new covenant.
 

1234
01:23:00,252 --> 01:23:01,913
And here's what God said he would do,
 

1235
01:23:01,913 --> 01:23:05,654
not in Ezekiel's day, but one day in the future.
 

1236
01:23:05,654 --> 01:23:09,316
I will sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean.
 

1237
01:23:09,316 --> 01:23:12,196
I will cleanse you from all your impurities
 

1238
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:13,457
and from all your idols.
 

1239
01:23:15,029 --> 01:23:16,210
Notice who will do that.
 

1240
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:16,830
I will.
 

1241
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:17,290
I will.
 

1242
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:18,311
God says I will.
 

1243
01:23:18,311 --> 01:23:18,931
Not you.
 

1244
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:19,312
I will.
 

1245
01:23:20,712 --> 01:23:22,574
I will give you a new heart.
 

1246
01:23:22,574 --> 01:23:24,315
Oh, I'll give you a new heart.
 

1247
01:23:24,315 --> 01:23:24,615
Why?
 

1248
01:23:24,615 --> 01:23:26,076
What's wrong with the old one?
 

1249
01:23:26,076 --> 01:23:26,676
It's hopeless.
 

1250
01:23:28,317 --> 01:23:31,139
Did you know that you're hopeless without God's new heart?
 

1251
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,580
That's what born again means.
 

1252
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:36,902
You have a new mind, a new heart, a new spirit.
 

1253
01:23:36,902 --> 01:23:39,824
And I'll put a new spirit in you.
 

1254
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:41,985
I'll remove from you your heart of stone,
 

1255
01:23:41,985 --> 01:23:46,459
that hardness and and arrogance and pride and stubbornness.
 

1256
01:23:46,459 --> 01:23:49,380
And I'll give you a heart of flesh, tender.
 

1257
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:50,801
I'll make you compassionate.
 

1258
01:23:50,801 --> 01:23:52,521
But here's the key.
 

1259
01:23:52,521 --> 01:23:55,883
And I will put my spirit in you
 

1260
01:23:55,883 --> 01:24:01,105
and move you to follow my decrees
 

1261
01:24:01,105 --> 01:24:03,265
and be careful to keep my laws.
 

1262
01:24:05,446 --> 01:24:08,052
Who will make me live different?
 

1263
01:24:08,052 --> 01:24:11,174
The spirit that God will put in us
 

1264
01:24:11,174 --> 01:24:14,677
will move us to be more like Christ.
 

1265
01:24:14,677 --> 01:24:16,358
Give us new desires.
 

1266
01:24:16,358 --> 01:24:17,759
How many, since you're a Christian
 

1267
01:24:17,759 --> 01:24:20,381
you have new desires like you never had before?
 

1268
01:24:20,381 --> 01:24:23,364
You have a desire to pick up the Bible and read it.
 

1269
01:24:23,364 --> 01:24:25,005
You never had one of those
 

1270
01:24:25,005 --> 01:24:27,827
when you were clubbing every weekend, right?
 

1271
01:24:29,108 --> 01:24:30,449
So there's new desires
 

1272
01:24:30,449 --> 01:24:31,890
there's new longings.
 

1273
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:35,968
Notice how this is the only way to defeat that old man.
 

1274
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,230
Because those voices from the past are still calling.
 

1275
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:41,031
Come on, come on, come on.
 

1276
01:24:41,031 --> 01:24:43,733
Don't get carried away with this religious stuff.
 

1277
01:24:43,733 --> 01:24:47,034
Come on, remember how it used to be and all of that.
 

1278
01:24:47,034 --> 01:24:50,396
And now the battle is sometimes the flesh and the spirit.
 

1279
01:24:50,396 --> 01:24:52,558
But notice what the spirit will do.
 

1280
01:24:52,558 --> 01:24:54,179
He will cause you.
 

1281
01:24:54,179 --> 01:24:55,880
He will move you.
 

1282
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,781
He will inspire you.
 

1283
01:24:57,781 --> 01:25:01,103
He will draw you to be more like Jesus.
 

1284
01:25:01,103 --> 01:25:02,744
How many want to be more like Jesus?
 

1285
01:25:02,744 --> 01:25:04,113
Say amen.
 

1286
01:25:04,113 --> 01:25:05,574
More pure, more holy.
 

1287
01:25:05,574 --> 01:25:06,695
Look, he's causing it.
 

1288
01:25:06,695 --> 01:25:08,297
He's causing it, not me.
 

1289
01:25:08,297 --> 01:25:09,438
He's pushing me.
 

1290
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:13,501
Well, the best way to overcome that is to be moving here.
 

1291
01:25:14,883 --> 01:25:16,564
You can't stay in the middle.
 

1292
01:25:16,564 --> 01:25:19,387
You got to be letting the spirit guide you.
 

1293
01:25:19,387 --> 01:25:21,328
I want to clean up your speech.
 

1294
01:25:21,328 --> 01:25:21,869
You know what?
 

1295
01:25:21,869 --> 01:25:23,010
You have a bad temper.
 

1296
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:27,100
You shouldn't have spoke so inappropriately.
 

1297
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:30,062
And he's putting all of these teachings in us
 

1298
01:25:30,062 --> 01:25:32,464
and causing us to go that other way.
 

1299
01:25:32,464 --> 01:25:33,885
So the Holy Spirit is in us
 

1300
01:25:33,885 --> 01:25:37,067
to bear witness that we are the children of God.
 

1301
01:25:37,067 --> 01:25:38,468
Praise God.
 

1302
01:25:38,468 --> 01:25:40,630
And then also to cause
 

1303
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:42,151
I will cause you.
 

1304
01:25:42,151 --> 01:25:45,373
The problem with the Old Testament was us.
 

1305
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:46,914
The law was fine.
 

1306
01:25:46,914 --> 01:25:48,495
It's me, the problem.
 

1307
01:25:48,495 --> 01:25:50,757
So God says, I'm going to get rid of Jim Simba.
 

1308
01:25:50,757 --> 01:25:53,919
I'm going to let him die spiritually.
 

1309
01:25:53,919 --> 01:25:55,416
And I'm going to cause...
 

1310
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:58,838
My son, Jesus, to live in him through the Holy Spirit.
 

1311
01:25:58,838 --> 01:26:01,159
And now I'm going to renovate him.
 

1312
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:03,600
Now I'm going to change him.
 

1313
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,721
You got to see these inmates at Angola.
 

1314
01:26:06,782 --> 01:26:11,184
There's one guy up for a double murder charge.
 

1315
01:26:11,184 --> 01:26:14,746
And he's going to die there unless God intervenes.
 

1316
01:26:14,746 --> 01:26:16,227
And if you met him
 

1317
01:26:16,227 --> 01:26:18,868
he's the most gentle person
 

1318
01:26:18,868 --> 01:26:23,030
that I can't describe how gentle he is.
 

1319
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:25,903
I have a picture I keep on my phone.
 

1320
01:26:25,903 --> 01:26:27,603
It was a meaningful moment.
 

1321
01:26:27,603 --> 01:26:30,004
I was there preaching in a chapel
 

1322
01:26:30,004 --> 01:26:32,304
filled with, let's say, 500 inmates,
 

1323
01:26:32,304 --> 01:26:37,585
no guards, no weapons, just me and a keyboard player
 

1324
01:26:37,585 --> 01:26:38,425
and these inmates.
 

1325
01:26:39,766 --> 01:26:44,166
And most of them were Christians.
 

1326
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:44,826
Some of them weren't.
 

1327
01:26:45,907 --> 01:26:47,427
And at the end, I ministered
 

1328
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:51,288
and then one of them yelled up at me, Pastor Jim
 

1329
01:26:52,368 --> 01:26:53,648
how can we pray for you?
 

1330
01:26:56,508 --> 01:26:59,610
They're looking at double life sentences
 

1331
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:01,451
but they want to know how to pray for me.
 

1332
01:27:02,732 --> 01:27:03,513
I said, yeah, well
 

1333
01:27:03,513 --> 01:27:05,774
I got a number of things you can pray about.
 

1334
01:27:05,774 --> 01:27:08,416
Suddenly he stands and he goes, come on, guys
 

1335
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:10,598
let's get him and pray for him.
 

1336
01:27:10,598 --> 01:27:11,599
When he said get him
 

1337
01:27:11,599 --> 01:27:14,140
I didn't know what that meant.
 

1338
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:16,922
You know, like, let's be careful with the language here,
 

1339
01:27:16,922 --> 01:27:17,483
okay?
 

1340
01:27:18,603 --> 01:27:23,026
And, yeah, and they just came up and surrounded me.
 

1341
01:27:23,026 --> 01:27:24,528
I have a picture of it.
 

1342
01:27:24,528 --> 01:27:28,574
There's like 40 of them laying hands on me
 

1343
01:27:28,574 --> 01:27:29,935
crying out to god for me
 

1344
01:27:31,296 --> 01:27:32,356
they're in there for murder
 

1345
01:27:33,357 --> 01:27:35,839
who would ever want what would change them to want
 

1346
01:27:35,839 --> 01:27:39,221
to pray for some minister that's that new heart
 

1347
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,343
how many thank god let's put our hands together
 

1348
01:27:42,343 --> 01:27:44,104
thank god for a new heart new life
 

1349
01:27:46,526 --> 01:27:48,503
so I saw some of you
 

1350
01:27:48,503 --> 01:27:49,543
I see it every Sunday
 

1351
01:27:49,543 --> 01:27:50,804
some of you visiting
 

1352
01:27:50,804 --> 01:27:52,124
you watch the choir sing
 

1353
01:27:52,124 --> 01:27:53,804
and you're watching people stand up
 

1354
01:27:53,804 --> 01:27:55,084
and I see you notice
 

1355
01:27:55,084 --> 01:27:55,965
why are they standing up?
 

1356
01:27:55,965 --> 01:27:57,065
Why are they lifting their hands?
 

1357
01:27:57,065 --> 01:27:58,225
Why are they emotional?
 

1358
01:27:58,225 --> 01:28:00,445
Why is that lady with the blonde hair always standing up
 

1359
01:28:00,445 --> 01:28:02,966
and worshiping God and praising God?
 

1360
01:28:02,966 --> 01:28:03,926
Don't you get it?
 

1361
01:28:03,926 --> 01:28:06,347
You don't know what we've experienced.
 

1362
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:08,787
We were lost, but now we're found.
 

1363
01:28:08,787 --> 01:28:10,667
We were blind, but now we see.
 

1364
01:28:10,667 --> 01:28:11,848
Congregation, let them know.
 

1365
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:13,808
Praise God.
 

1366
01:28:17,654 --> 01:28:22,638
So lastly, here's some gems of what God planned
 

1367
01:28:22,638 --> 01:28:24,919
for us through the Holy Spirit.
 

1368
01:28:24,919 --> 01:28:25,900
Please remember these.
 

1369
01:28:27,301 --> 01:28:28,882
Jesus said this in John.
 

1370
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:33,125
He said, all this I have spoken while still with you.
 

1371
01:28:34,646 --> 01:28:39,009
But the advocate, or the word can be helper, the Holy Spirit
 

1372
01:28:39,009 --> 01:28:41,911
whom the Father will send in my name
 

1373
01:28:41,911 --> 01:28:43,993
will teach you all things.
 

1374
01:28:46,434 --> 01:28:51,436
And we will remind you of everything I have said to you.
 

1375
01:28:52,556 --> 01:28:54,497
So now listen as Jeffrey comes.
 

1376
01:28:57,037 --> 01:28:59,338
When you read this Bible
 

1377
01:28:59,338 --> 01:29:00,739
if you could have a minister
 

1378
01:29:00,739 --> 01:29:04,580
or a commentary next to you, that's helpful.
 

1379
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,421
But the best teacher is the Holy Spirit.
 

1380
01:29:09,781 --> 01:29:11,622
So when you read it, look at me.
 

1381
01:29:11,622 --> 01:29:12,262
When you read it
 

1382
01:29:13,623 --> 01:29:15,043
just stop before you read it.
 

1383
01:29:16,354 --> 01:29:19,496
Holy Spirit, teach me what this means.
 

1384
01:29:20,877 --> 01:29:22,158
You wrote it.
 

1385
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:23,619
Apply it to my heart.
 

1386
01:29:23,619 --> 01:29:24,339
Thank you, Lord.
 

1387
01:29:24,339 --> 01:29:25,460
I know you're going to help me.
 

1388
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:28,082
And the Holy Spirit teaches.
 

1389
01:29:28,082 --> 01:29:30,623
Now, when the Holy Spirit teaches us
 

1390
01:29:30,623 --> 01:29:33,005
it's called revelation.
 

1391
01:29:33,005 --> 01:29:35,847
Not the book of Revelation, but revelation.
 

1392
01:29:35,847 --> 01:29:38,388
The Spirit imparting to our minds
 

1393
01:29:38,388 --> 01:29:40,650
and our hearts the meaning of these verses.
 

1394
01:29:41,758 --> 01:29:42,658
And applying it.
 

1395
01:29:42,658 --> 01:29:44,279
And there's no bottom to it.
 

1396
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:44,979
You can read.
 

1397
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:47,801
How many have read a verse like 20 times?
 

1398
01:29:47,801 --> 01:29:49,561
And you read it for the 21st time.
 

1399
01:29:50,842 --> 01:29:52,743
And the thing opens up and you go,
 

1400
01:29:52,743 --> 01:29:54,484
oh no, I didn't know it meant that.
 

1401
01:29:54,484 --> 01:29:56,344
How many have ever had that happen, right?
 

1402
01:29:56,344 --> 01:29:57,925
You're reading and you're reading and you're reading
 

1403
01:29:57,925 --> 01:29:58,786
and then you go, what?
 

1404
01:30:00,226 --> 01:30:02,667
That's the Holy Spirit teaching you.
 

1405
01:30:02,667 --> 01:30:03,628
Teaching me.
 

1406
01:30:03,628 --> 01:30:04,608
He's the best teacher.
 

1407
01:30:05,929 --> 01:30:07,910
All other teachers can go sideways, but
 

1408
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:08,950
never the Holy Spirit.
 

1409
01:30:10,206 --> 01:30:12,127
He gives us the meaning of this.
 

1410
01:30:13,387 --> 01:30:15,888
And he edifies us.
 

1411
01:30:15,888 --> 01:30:16,989
He applies it to our heart.
 

1412
01:30:16,989 --> 01:30:21,050
Don't read the Bible with con su cabeza solo
 

1413
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:24,232
but con su corazón.
 

1414
01:30:24,232 --> 01:30:25,952
Ask the Holy Spirit to teach you.
 

1415
01:30:25,952 --> 01:30:27,713
Read it with your heart.
 

1416
01:30:27,713 --> 01:30:31,334
These words are spirit and life, Jesus said.
 

1417
01:30:31,334 --> 01:30:32,835
So they have to be understood
 

1418
01:30:32,835 --> 01:30:35,737
through the Holy Spirit teaching us what it means.
 

1419
01:30:35,737 --> 01:30:39,680
By the way, that's why Jesus chose 12 fishermen
 

1420
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:43,123
and tax collectors to be his followers
 

1421
01:30:43,123 --> 01:30:46,425
because they'd have to depend on the Holy Spirit.
 

1422
01:30:46,425 --> 01:30:48,407
If they had gone to the rabbinical schools
 

1423
01:30:48,407 --> 01:30:50,028
and they were famous rabbis
 

1424
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:51,309
they would have fallen back on
 

1425
01:30:51,309 --> 01:30:54,291
what they had learned in religious schooling.
 

1426
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:56,293
But now they had nothing.
 

1427
01:30:56,293 --> 01:30:58,014
They used to catch fish in the net.
 

1428
01:30:58,014 --> 01:30:59,715
How would they know how to minister?
 

1429
01:30:59,715 --> 01:31:02,497
So they would have to look to the Holy Spirit all the time.
 

1430
01:31:02,497 --> 01:31:04,579
Holy Spirit, help me.
 

1431
01:31:04,579 --> 01:31:04,719
Help.
 

1432
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:07,212
I said it last week.
 

1433
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:09,434
I think I want to say it again.
 

1434
01:31:09,434 --> 01:31:11,134
If I've ever helped you
 

1435
01:31:11,134 --> 01:31:12,655
if any song Carol ever wrote
 

1436
01:31:12,655 --> 01:31:13,756
or anything she ever said
 

1437
01:31:13,756 --> 01:31:16,897
or did has ever helped you, trust me
 

1438
01:31:16,897 --> 01:31:18,258
it's not us.
 

1439
01:31:18,258 --> 01:31:21,839
It's the Holy Spirit blessing you through us.
 

1440
01:31:21,839 --> 01:31:23,520
We can't impart blessing.
 

1441
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,741
Only God can do that.
 

1442
01:31:26,001 --> 01:31:28,923
So now we know he's our teacher.
 

1443
01:31:28,923 --> 01:31:30,824
Everybody say teacher.
 

1444
01:31:30,824 --> 01:31:32,324
That's my teacher.
 

1445
01:31:32,324 --> 01:31:34,405
Don't read the Bible without saying that prayer.
 

1446
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:36,201
You don't have to give a long prayer.
 

1447
01:31:36,201 --> 01:31:40,563
Just Holy Spirit, give me light, illumine me, my heart
 

1448
01:31:40,563 --> 01:31:44,304
so that I can see new things in your word.
 

1449
01:31:44,304 --> 01:31:47,225
Those prayers are found especially in Psalm 119.
 

1450
01:31:47,225 --> 01:31:48,146
Open my eyes, Lord
 

1451
01:31:48,146 --> 01:31:49,226
that I might see new
 

1452
01:31:49,226 --> 01:31:50,867
and marvelous things in your law.
 

1453
01:31:52,367 --> 01:31:53,708
But then there's more.
 

1454
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:55,108
There's fake teachers.
 

1455
01:31:56,669 --> 01:31:59,430
There's fake preachers.
 

1456
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:01,351
There's fake doctrine.
 

1457
01:32:01,351 --> 01:32:01,971
Paul said
 

1458
01:32:01,971 --> 01:32:04,792
in the last days there will be doctrines of demons.
 

1459
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:07,394
Read it.
 

1460
01:32:08,415 --> 01:32:09,836
First and second Timothy.
 

1461
01:32:09,836 --> 01:32:11,477
Timothy, be careful.
 

1462
01:32:11,477 --> 01:32:13,038
Ministers are going to come.
 

1463
01:32:13,038 --> 01:32:17,922
And just like Satan imitates an angel of light
 

1464
01:32:17,922 --> 01:32:20,424
these ministers are going to come with cunning.
 

1465
01:32:21,704 --> 01:32:24,310
Oh, they'll be so convincing.
 

1466
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:27,312
But they'll bring in false teaching, false doctrine.
 

1467
01:32:27,312 --> 01:32:29,194
They'll get you away from Jesus.
 

1468
01:32:29,194 --> 01:32:31,375
They'll get you away from holy living.
 

1469
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,197
They'll get your mind taken up with money
 

1470
01:32:33,197 --> 01:32:34,758
and the pleasures of life.
 

1471
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:35,919
They're con artists
 

1472
01:32:35,919 --> 01:32:39,181
but they're very cunning, very cunning.
 

1473
01:32:40,502 --> 01:32:42,104
Some are legalistic.
 

1474
01:32:42,104 --> 01:32:43,625
They want to add to Jesus.
 

1475
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:44,285
They'll say, no
 

1476
01:32:44,285 --> 01:32:46,727
you're not saved by faith in Jesus alone.
 

1477
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:47,568
You have to do this.
 

1478
01:32:47,568 --> 01:32:48,889
You have to worship on this day,
 

1479
01:32:48,889 --> 01:32:50,943
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 

1480
01:32:50,943 --> 01:32:52,384
Others on the other side.
 

1481
01:32:52,384 --> 01:32:53,665
Don't get hung up.
 

1482
01:32:53,665 --> 01:32:55,307
There's no such thing as sin.
 

1483
01:32:55,307 --> 01:32:56,868
If it feels good, you do it.
 

1484
01:32:57,949 --> 01:32:59,410
Because God wants you happy.
 

1485
01:33:00,451 --> 01:33:00,891
You get it?
 

1486
01:33:02,012 --> 01:33:03,873
Are you following what I'm saying?
 

1487
01:33:03,873 --> 01:33:05,915
So now listen what John says.
 

1488
01:33:05,915 --> 01:33:07,516
Same cure.
 

1489
01:33:07,516 --> 01:33:09,078
Same answer.
 

1490
01:33:09,078 --> 01:33:10,218
In 1 John he says
 

1491
01:33:10,218 --> 01:33:11,580
I'm writing these things to you
 

1492
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:14,562
about those who are trying to lead you astray.
 

1493
01:33:14,562 --> 01:33:15,483
Brothers and sisters,
 

1494
01:33:15,483 --> 01:33:17,804
there are people trying to lead all of us astray.
 

1495
01:33:19,424 --> 01:33:21,765
Okay, would you read that verse with me out loud?
 

1496
01:33:21,765 --> 01:33:22,505
Come on.
 

1497
01:33:22,505 --> 01:33:25,465
I am writing these things to you
 

1498
01:33:25,465 --> 01:33:29,486
about those who are trying to lead you astray.
 

1499
01:33:33,687 --> 01:33:35,728
I don't want to get started on that.
 

1500
01:33:35,728 --> 01:33:36,588
I lose my peace.
 

1501
01:33:37,928 --> 01:33:42,349
Con artists using all kinds of trickery to get money.
 

1502
01:33:46,597 --> 01:33:49,559
As for you, the anointing, what anointing?
 

1503
01:33:49,559 --> 01:33:51,240
The help of the Holy Spirit
 

1504
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:54,102
that you received from him remains in you.
 

1505
01:33:54,102 --> 01:33:55,163
See, inside.
 

1506
01:33:55,163 --> 01:33:57,205
And you do not need anyone to teach you.
 

1507
01:33:58,946 --> 01:34:01,648
But as his anointing teaches you about all things
 

1508
01:34:01,648 --> 01:34:03,509
and as that anointing is real,
 

1509
01:34:03,509 --> 01:34:05,951
not counterfeit like the teachers
 

1510
01:34:05,951 --> 01:34:09,413
just as it has taught you, remain in him.
 

1511
01:34:10,554 --> 01:34:14,029
Remain in union with Christ.
 

1512
01:34:14,029 --> 01:34:16,712
And that anointing will help you to discern
 

1513
01:34:16,712 --> 01:34:18,954
the tricks of the trade
 

1514
01:34:18,954 --> 01:34:20,276
of these false teachers.
 

1515
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:24,841
Notice, you have an anointing that teaches you all things.
 

1516
01:34:24,841 --> 01:34:26,622
You don't have a need for anyone to teach you.
 

1517
01:34:26,622 --> 01:34:28,184
Now look, look at me
 

1518
01:34:28,184 --> 01:34:29,501
and I'll close.
 

1519
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:33,325
If a human teacher would be the determining factor
 

1520
01:34:33,325 --> 01:34:35,206
on how mature a person is
 

1521
01:34:35,206 --> 01:34:35,206
,
 

1522
01:34:35,206 --> 01:34:35,427
oh
 

1523
01:34:35,427 --> 01:34:36,508
she's a great Christian
 

1524
01:34:36,508 --> 01:34:39,210
because she sat under this teacher or that teacher.
 

1525
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:40,591
Would God be fair?
 

1526
01:34:40,591 --> 01:34:41,933
What if someone got saved
 

1527
01:34:41,933 --> 01:34:45,176
like I know people in northern Argentina,
 

1528
01:34:45,176 --> 01:34:49,339
up in the province of Encorrientes
 

1529
01:34:50,681 --> 01:34:52,002
or Formosa?
 

1530
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:57,153
And there's mucho pobrecitos, very poor
 

1531
01:34:57,153 --> 01:34:58,674
and they meet in a little church
 

1532
01:34:58,674 --> 01:35:01,797
and the pastor's just been saved a couple of years himself
 

1533
01:35:01,797 --> 01:35:04,059
but that's what it is there.
 

1534
01:35:04,059 --> 01:35:05,940
Well, then that person can't grow.
 

1535
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:07,222
That person can't be mature.
 

1536
01:35:07,222 --> 01:35:07,662
Why?
 

1537
01:35:07,662 --> 01:35:10,404
They don't have a great Bible teacher to help them.
 

1538
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:11,325
No!
 

1539
01:35:11,325 --> 01:35:13,187
They can become a better Christian than you
 

1540
01:35:13,187 --> 01:35:13,487
and me
 

1541
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:16,069
because they have an anointing
 

1542
01:35:16,069 --> 01:35:17,531
that teaches them all things.
 

1543
01:35:18,952 --> 01:35:21,174
It's the Holy Spirit that keeps us straight.
 

1544
01:35:22,623 --> 01:35:25,024
And keeps us in line with his word.
 

1545
01:35:26,205 --> 01:35:28,446
So discernment is so needed today.
 

1546
01:35:28,446 --> 01:35:29,846
Because I'm just telling you
 

1547
01:35:29,846 --> 01:35:31,887
there's a lot of junk out there.
 

1548
01:35:31,887 --> 01:35:33,188
There's a lot of great churches
 

1549
01:35:33,188 --> 01:35:34,788
and good men and women of God.
 

1550
01:35:34,788 --> 01:35:39,250
But there's a lot of weird, weird, weird, weird stuff.
 

1551
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,070
Right?
 

1552
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:41,211
Always remember this, though,
 

1553
01:35:41,211 --> 01:35:42,952
as a little tip just from your pastor.
 

1554
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:47,474
Whenever it's showy
 

1555
01:35:47,474 --> 01:35:50,555
and they're drawing attention to themselves, walk away.
 

1556
01:35:52,376 --> 01:35:55,538
No one who ever met Jesus had the encounter with Jesus,
 

1557
01:35:55,538 --> 01:35:57,219
strutted around, acting proud.
 

1558
01:35:58,239 --> 01:35:59,840
Impossibly.
 

1559
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,861
When you meet Jesus, you go down.
 

1560
01:36:01,861 --> 01:36:03,422
How many say amen?
 

1561
01:36:03,422 --> 01:36:05,723
So that he can lift you up.
 

1562
01:36:05,723 --> 01:36:07,864
When you don't know Jesus, you go up
 

1563
01:36:07,864 --> 01:36:11,686
but not knowing that he will one day bring you down.
 

1564
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:18,910
Just thought of that song
 

1565
01:36:18,910 --> 01:36:20,777
but it doesn't fit this.
 

1566
01:36:20,777 --> 01:36:22,277
You got to know when to hold them
 

1567
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,758
and when to fold them and when to walk away.
 

1568
01:36:24,758 --> 01:36:26,998
That has nothing to do with what I just said, does it?
 

1569
01:36:28,219 --> 01:36:29,799
But you got to know when to walk away.
 

1570
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,680
Walk away.
 

1571
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:35,460
You see someone drawing attention to themselves?
 

1572
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:36,341
Bye.
 

1573
01:36:36,341 --> 01:36:37,641
I'm not interested in you.
 

1574
01:36:38,701 --> 01:36:40,982
I'm not interested in you, Jim Cimbala.
 

1575
01:36:40,982 --> 01:36:42,822
I want to hear the word of the Lord.
 

1576
01:36:42,822 --> 01:36:45,063
I want to know Jesus better.
 

1577
01:36:45,063 --> 01:36:50,934
Okay, lastly, and this is so beautiful.
 

1578
01:36:50,934 --> 01:36:53,438
Many times people want to live for God
 

1579
01:36:53,438 --> 01:36:55,922
but they get thrown in a situation.
 

1580
01:36:55,922 --> 01:36:58,806
I'm thinking of something that my wife went through.
 

1581
01:36:58,806 --> 01:37:02,712
When we rented Radio City Music Hall,
 

1582
01:37:02,712 --> 01:37:04,454
6,000 seats for the first time
 

1583
01:37:04,454 --> 01:37:06,217
and they told her and us
 

1584
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,462
When the choir comes up on that elevator,
 

1585
01:37:11,462 --> 01:37:13,482
biggest elevator in the world
 

1586
01:37:13,482 --> 01:37:15,023
biggest stage in the world
 

1587
01:37:15,023 --> 01:37:15,923
when they come up
 

1588
01:37:15,923 --> 01:37:18,124
like the Rockettes do during the Christmas show
 

1589
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:21,365
when they come up singing with their gowns on
 

1590
01:37:21,365 --> 01:37:22,726
and praising God
 

1591
01:37:22,726 --> 01:37:24,447
after that first song, Carol
 

1592
01:37:24,447 --> 01:37:28,268
you have to walk and talk to the whole audience.
 

1593
01:37:28,268 --> 01:37:31,969
And at that time, she was very, very, very, very shy.
 

1594
01:37:31,969 --> 01:37:33,330
She told me ten times
 

1595
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:34,710
I can't do that.
 

1596
01:37:34,710 --> 01:37:35,211
You go.
 

1597
01:37:35,211 --> 01:37:37,143
I said, no, I'm not doing it.
 

1598
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:38,564
You're in charge of the choir.
 

1599
01:37:38,564 --> 01:37:39,845
I'm not.
 

1600
01:37:39,845 --> 01:37:42,307
Husbands, where does it say husband obey your wives?
 

1601
01:37:42,307 --> 01:37:43,988
Is that in the Bible?
 

1602
01:37:43,988 --> 01:37:45,269
Does someone find that in there?
 

1603
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:48,291
William, don't let her do that to you.
 

1604
01:37:48,291 --> 01:37:49,752
Don't let her boss you around.
 

1605
01:37:49,752 --> 01:37:50,893
I'm only kidding.
 

1606
01:37:50,893 --> 01:37:55,356
So anyway, here's the promise.
 

1607
01:37:57,578 --> 01:38:00,120
When you are brought before synagogues
 

1608
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,601
and Radio City Music Hall,
 

1609
01:38:02,817 --> 01:38:04,379
Rulers and authorities
 

1610
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:09,425
do not worry about how you will defend yourselves
 

1611
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:10,926
or what you will say.
 

1612
01:38:10,926 --> 01:38:16,533
For the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time
 

1613
01:38:16,533 --> 01:38:18,075
what you should say.
 

1614
01:38:18,075 --> 01:38:20,017
Can we clap our hands together?
 

1615
01:38:25,337 --> 01:38:27,319
My wife walked out there that night.
 

1616
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:28,640
God came on her to help her.
 

1617
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,962
The Holy Spirit did.
 

1618
01:38:29,962 --> 01:38:32,364
And she was getting sick from nerves.
 

1619
01:38:32,364 --> 01:38:34,066
She took that microphone.
 

1620
01:38:34,066 --> 01:38:34,707
Praise God.
 

1621
01:38:34,707 --> 01:38:36,308
She started walking around the stage.
 

1622
01:38:36,308 --> 01:38:36,829
No, she didn't.
 

1623
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:39,712
But she was moving for a thing.
 

1624
01:38:40,973 --> 01:38:41,373
Why?
 

1625
01:38:41,373 --> 01:38:42,775
Because the Holy Spirit helps us.
 

1626
01:38:43,852 --> 01:38:44,513
So look at me.
 

1627
01:38:44,513 --> 01:38:45,293
Look at me.
 

1628
01:38:45,293 --> 01:38:47,515
Never feel like I don't know enough verses.
 

1629
01:38:47,515 --> 01:38:49,596
What if they ask me this question?
 

1630
01:38:49,596 --> 01:38:50,917
I want to give my testimony.
 

1631
01:38:50,917 --> 01:38:51,678
I want to do this.
 

1632
01:38:51,678 --> 01:38:52,359
I want to do that.
 

1633
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:53,179
But I can't.
 

1634
01:38:53,179 --> 01:38:54,240
I'm not ready.
 

1635
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,301
You'll never be ready.
 

1636
01:38:55,301 --> 01:38:57,402
The Holy Spirit is ready.
 

1637
01:38:57,402 --> 01:39:00,905
And in any situation God puts you in, Jesus said
 

1638
01:39:00,905 --> 01:39:03,307
don't worry about what you will say.
 

1639
01:39:03,307 --> 01:39:05,829
I'll give you what you will say through the Holy Spirit.
 

1640
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:09,232
No, some of you don't believe it.
 

1641
01:39:09,232 --> 01:39:10,913
So I'm going to stay on it one more time.
 

1642
01:39:12,021 --> 01:39:14,283
Never say, I don't know what to do.
 

1643
01:39:14,283 --> 01:39:15,384
I'm not used to that.
 

1644
01:39:15,384 --> 01:39:16,425
That's not my gifting.
 

1645
01:39:16,425 --> 01:39:18,867
Listen, when you end up in a situation
 

1646
01:39:18,867 --> 01:39:22,390
where you have to talk or react, don't worry beforehand.
 

1647
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:23,390
Take out your notes.
 

1648
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:24,411
If I only had notes.
 

1649
01:39:26,113 --> 01:39:28,154
No, you just open your heart.
 

1650
01:39:28,154 --> 01:39:30,316
Show me, Holy Spirit, what to say.
 

1651
01:39:30,316 --> 01:39:32,518
How many believe he'll do it every single time?
 

1652
01:39:32,518 --> 01:39:33,138
Will he do it?
 

1653
01:39:33,138 --> 01:39:34,779
That's the problem.
 

1654
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:37,502
Come on out, choir.
 

1655
01:39:38,983 --> 01:39:40,324
What a wonderful God we have.
 

1656
01:39:41,671 --> 01:39:43,692
Now you appreciate the Holy Spirit more?
 

1657
01:39:45,434 --> 01:39:46,094
Treasure him.
 

1658
01:39:47,295 --> 01:39:48,796
Treasure him.
 

1659
01:39:48,796 --> 01:39:51,978
The sweetest moments in my life, my wife's life,
 

1660
01:39:51,978 --> 01:39:54,099
and in the history of this church
 

1661
01:39:54,099 --> 01:39:54,240
are
 

1662
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,781
when we've had visitations of the Holy Spirit.
 

1663
01:39:58,402 --> 01:40:00,604
Oh, did you know this?
 

1664
01:40:01,825 --> 01:40:05,427
One time Peter went to Cornelius' house.
 

1665
01:40:05,427 --> 01:40:07,629
Cornelius was a Roman soldier.
 

1666
01:40:07,629 --> 01:40:09,690
There were no Christians who were Gentiles yet.
 

1667
01:40:12,549 --> 01:40:13,869
And the Bible says Peter went,
 

1668
01:40:13,869 --> 01:40:17,650
led by God, to preach to this whole household of people.
 

1669
01:40:19,171 --> 01:40:22,992
And while he was still speaking, Peter
 

1670
01:40:22,992 --> 01:40:24,412
read Acts 10 when you go home
 

1671
01:40:25,732 --> 01:40:30,454
the Holy Spirit fell on everyone who was listening
 

1672
01:40:30,454 --> 01:40:31,034
to the word.
 

1673
01:40:32,114 --> 01:40:34,675
Not an individual, the whole group.
 

1674
01:40:37,075 --> 01:40:39,056
And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.
 

1675
01:40:40,311 --> 01:40:42,973
And the believers that were with Peter knew they were
 

1676
01:40:42,973 --> 01:40:45,235
because they were all speaking in tongues
 

1677
01:40:45,235 --> 01:40:47,797
just like Peter and the other believers did
 

1678
01:40:47,797 --> 01:40:49,358
on the day of Pentecost.
 

1679
01:40:49,358 --> 01:40:51,500
They spoke in languages they didn't know
 

1680
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:54,222
because the Spirit can cause you to do whatever he wants
 

1681
01:40:54,222 --> 01:40:54,642
you to do.
 

1682
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:56,984
And they said,
 

1683
01:40:56,984 --> 01:40:59,806
we can't stop these guys from getting baptized.
 

1684
01:40:59,806 --> 01:41:02,348
They're filled with the same Holy Spirit that filled us.
 

1685
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:07,132
So the Spirit, we should always be sensitive in the meeting.
 

1686
01:41:07,132 --> 01:41:10,311
The Spirit can fall on a congregation.
 

1687
01:41:10,311 --> 01:41:12,173
And do things we can't imagine.
 

1688
01:41:12,173 --> 01:41:12,593
All right?
 

1689
01:41:12,593 --> 01:41:15,235
Some of you are battling with that, fighting with that.
 

1690
01:41:15,235 --> 01:41:18,518
No, I'm going to tell you the truth as it is in Christ.
 

1691
01:41:18,518 --> 01:41:19,919
While we're worshiping God
 

1692
01:41:19,919 --> 01:41:20,799
it could happen now
 

1693
01:41:20,799 --> 01:41:22,180
it could happen Tuesday night
 

1694
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:25,663
the Spirit can fall on us
 

1695
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,404
and lead us into worship
 

1696
01:41:27,404 --> 01:41:31,628
or ecstasy or a new filling of the Holy Spirit.
 

1697
01:41:31,628 --> 01:41:34,790
And the Holy Spirit does that.
 

1698
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:38,453
And we should recognize that and honor his presence.
 

1699
01:41:38,453 --> 01:41:39,174
Amen or no amen?
 

1700
01:41:39,174 --> 01:41:39,334
Amen.
 

1701
01:41:40,661 --> 01:41:44,263
Carol recorded a song years ago with the choir, Psalm 34.
 

1702
01:41:45,323 --> 01:41:46,324
And when the song ended
 

1703
01:41:46,324 --> 01:41:47,784
it was a live recording.
 

1704
01:41:47,784 --> 01:41:49,145
Did you know this, Jeffrey?
 

1705
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:50,646
When the song ended
 

1706
01:41:50,646 --> 01:41:53,987
one of the duet guys that was walking off just said,
 

1707
01:41:53,987 --> 01:41:55,528
praise God.
 

1708
01:41:55,528 --> 01:41:59,570
And suddenly I was on the edge of that right there.
 

1709
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:00,350
The next thing was
 

1710
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:03,051
I was supposed to walk out and do something.
 

1711
01:42:03,051 --> 01:42:05,352
Oh, did God freeze me.
 

1712
01:42:05,352 --> 01:42:07,153
And suddenly the spirit came down.
 

1713
01:42:08,673 --> 01:42:09,654
And for the next
 

1714
01:42:09,654 --> 01:42:13,736
I don't know, five minutes, seven minutes, ten minutes
 

1715
01:42:13,736 --> 01:42:16,077
there was nothing but an ocean of prey.
 

1716
01:42:17,398 --> 01:42:18,659
People got lost.
 

1717
01:42:18,659 --> 01:42:20,179
People fell on their knees.
 

1718
01:42:20,179 --> 01:42:21,280
People stood.
 

1719
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,801
People were weeping.
 

1720
01:42:22,801 --> 01:42:24,702
And the Holy Spirit was conducting.
 

1721
01:42:24,702 --> 01:42:25,642
No one said a word.
 

1722
01:42:25,642 --> 01:42:26,943
My wife never said a word.
 

1723
01:42:26,943 --> 01:42:27,964
I never said a word.
 

1724
01:42:27,964 --> 01:42:29,584
Nobody said a word in the choir.
 

1725
01:42:29,584 --> 01:42:31,345
And we were all lost in God.
 

1726
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:31,906
Why?
 

1727
01:42:31,906 --> 01:42:33,166
Because where the wind blows
 

1728
01:42:33,166 --> 01:42:34,067
you follow the wind.
 

1729
01:42:36,511 --> 01:42:38,852
Are you open to that or are you all dead?
 

1730
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:42,093
I don't want to be a deadhead.
 

1731
01:42:42,093 --> 01:42:43,574
I want to be alive to God.
 

1732
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:46,495
I don't want emotionalism.
 

1733
01:42:46,495 --> 01:42:48,275
I don't want fake anything.
 

1734
01:42:48,275 --> 01:42:49,656
I'm not doing that.
 

1735
01:42:49,656 --> 01:42:51,916
I don't want to work up some frenzy.
 

1736
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:55,198
But oh, am I hungry for the Holy Spirit right now?
 

1737
01:42:56,538 --> 01:42:57,538
When you talk about him
 

1738
01:42:57,538 --> 01:42:59,699
you get more hungry for him.
 

1739
01:42:59,699 --> 01:43:01,860
So we want to teach you a song.
 

1740
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:02,820
If you know it
 

1741
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:03,641
you can sing along.
 

1742
01:43:03,641 --> 01:43:04,681
But otherwise, just listen.
 

1743
01:43:06,116 --> 01:43:07,436
If you could lift the instruments.
 

1744
01:43:13,318 --> 01:43:41,656
Wonderful Counselor Mighty God our father prince
 

1745
01:43:41,656 --> 01:44:08,634

Sing loud.
 

1747
01:44:09,475 --> 01:44:10,195
Sing.
 

1748
01:44:10,195 --> 01:44:12,057
Come on.
 

1749
01:44:12,057 --> 01:44:17,201
Come on.
 

1750
01:44:36,964 --> 01:44:37,324
We go.
 

1751
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,581
If you need a word from the Lord
 

1752
01:44:58,581 --> 01:45:00,602
if you have to make a decision
 

1753
01:45:00,602 --> 01:45:01,743
you need his teaching
 

1754
01:45:01,743 --> 01:45:03,964
come up out of your seat.
 

1755
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:04,604
Come on.
 

1756
01:45:04,604 --> 01:45:06,705
Maybe God brought you here just for that.
 

1757
01:45:06,705 --> 01:45:07,165
Sing.
 

1758
01:45:07,165 --> 01:45:12,968
Wonderful.
 

1759
01:45:12,968 --> 01:45:14,569
I need a word from the Lord, Pastor.
 

1760
01:45:14,569 --> 01:45:15,929
I need the Holy Spirit.
 

1761
01:45:15,929 --> 01:45:19,711
Wonderful.
 

1762
01:45:21,332 --> 01:45:23,613
Mighty God.
 

1763
01:45:34,093 --> 01:45:35,394
Come on, everyone.
 

1764
01:45:35,394 --> 01:45:37,516
Praise the King.

Great I Am.
 

1766
01:45:39,898 --> 01:45:41,579
Come on up to the front.
 

1767
01:45:41,579 --> 01:45:45,142
God's going to speak to you.
 

1768
01:45:45,142 --> 01:45:55,870
The Holy Spirit is going to guide you and lead you.
 

1769
01:46:01,847 --> 01:46:03,348
Lift your hands in the building.
 

1770
01:46:03,348 --> 01:46:04,048
Sing.
 

1771
01:46:04,048 --> 01:46:17,397
Wonderful Counselor
 

1772
01:46:18,678 --> 01:46:29,421

Oh, my God.
 

1775
01:46:31,341 --> 01:46:31,581
Sing.
 

1776
01:46:32,702 --> 01:46:39,604
Praise the King.
 

1777
01:46:39,604 --> 01:46:46,767
The great I Am.
 

1778
01:46:46,767 --> 01:46:48,667
We glorify.
 

1779
01:46:48,667 --> 01:46:52,649
We glorify.
 

1780
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:58,932
Everybody stand up.
 

1781
01:46:58,932 --> 01:47:00,613
Stand up and sing, everyone.
 

1782
01:47:01,634 --> 01:47:07,280
Wonderful.
 

1783
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,281
Let the church sing.
 

1784
01:47:08,281 --> 01:47:13,006
Let the church sing to Jesus Christ.
 

1785
01:47:13,006 --> 01:47:14,448
We honor you, Jesus.
 

1786
01:47:14,448 --> 01:47:15,569
We praise you, Jesus.
 

1787
01:47:15,569 --> 01:47:16,189

Sing.
 

1796
01:47:58,909 --> 01:48:00,711
Wonderful.
 

1797
01:48:03,093 --> 01:48:07,016
Lift your hands to Almighty God and praise Him.
 

1798
01:48:07,016 --> 01:48:09,919
For Jesus is worthy of all praise.
 

1799
01:48:09,919 --> 01:48:13,321
He has been given a name above every other name.
 

1800
01:48:13,321 --> 01:48:16,164
That if the name of Jesus every knee shall bow
 

1801
01:48:16,164 --> 01:48:20,788
every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord of all.
 

1802
01:48:22,288 --> 01:48:28,192
there's a glory upon the father
 

1803
01:48:28,192 --> 01:48:54,046
prince we fall without Last time
 

1804
01:48:54,046 --> 01:48:56,267
for all of us, sing.
 

1805
01:48:56,267 --> 01:49:03,070
Wonderful.
 

1806
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:05,331
Master.
 

1807
01:49:05,331 --> 01:49:09,953
Mighty God.
 

1808
01:49:24,902 --> 01:49:28,965
We love you, Jesus.
 

1809
01:49:28,965 --> 01:49:31,007
We love you, Jesus.
 

1810
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:05,510
Holy Spirit fill our church
 

1811
01:50:06,571 --> 01:50:08,891
with the fullness of all of your power
 

1812
01:50:08,891 --> 01:50:12,332
and grace and the gifts of the Holy Spirit
 

1813
01:50:14,912 --> 01:50:16,193
let no one hold back
 

1814
01:50:19,133 --> 01:50:23,434
but let everyone be open to everything you want to do in us
 

1815
01:50:23,434 --> 01:50:24,914
Bear witness all the time
 

1816
01:50:24,914 --> 01:50:27,415
with our spirit that we are the children of God.
 

1817
01:50:28,475 --> 01:50:29,636
Satan, you're a liar.
 

1818
01:50:29,636 --> 01:50:30,776
We belong to God.
 

1819
01:50:30,776 --> 01:50:32,757
He is our father.
 

1820
01:50:35,578 --> 01:50:38,198
Cause us to walk in your ways by your power,
 

1821
01:50:38,198 --> 01:50:40,379
not by our good intentions.
 

1822
01:50:41,719 --> 01:50:42,860
Not by self-effort.
 

1823
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:43,780
We can't do it.
 

1824
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:44,680
We've tried, Lord.
 

1825
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:45,680
We've tried.
 

1826
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:49,442
God, I have tried with good intentions to change.
 

1827
01:50:49,442 --> 01:50:50,202
I can't do it.
 

1828
01:50:50,202 --> 01:50:50,982
You have to do it.
 

1829
01:50:52,476 --> 01:50:55,779
So Spirit, come like a mighty rushing wind.
 

1830
01:50:55,779 --> 01:50:57,980
Come like a river and flow through us
 

1831
01:50:59,221 --> 01:51:01,983
showing the sweetness of Jesus to everyone around us.
 

1832
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:11,591
Open your word to us.
 

1833
01:51:13,072 --> 01:51:13,792
Be our teacher.
 

1834
01:51:17,075 --> 01:51:18,236
Every day,
 

1835
01:51:18,236 --> 01:51:20,938
give us the prompting to get alone with our Bibles.
 

1836
01:51:22,032 --> 01:51:23,993
Every one of us in this room, Lord
 

1837
01:51:23,993 --> 01:51:25,514
we need your word every day
 

1838
01:51:25,514 --> 01:51:27,795
but we need it taught by the Holy Spirit.
 

1839
01:51:29,796 --> 01:51:32,217
Help us to have the faith to trust you to do that.
 

1840
01:51:34,498 --> 01:51:37,659
Keep us from false doctrine, false teachers,
 

1841
01:51:37,659 --> 01:51:39,180
tricksters, con artists
 

1842
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:41,961
doctrines that seem good
 

1843
01:51:41,961 --> 01:51:42,702
but they're not.
 

1844
01:51:42,702 --> 01:51:44,002
Give us discernment.
 

1845
01:51:44,002 --> 01:51:47,884
Let the anointing that's in all of us, Lord, keep us away.
 

1846
01:51:51,076 --> 01:51:53,037
from the wolves in sheep's clothing.
 

1847
01:51:55,618 --> 01:52:00,539
Finally, give us the faith that no matter what we face
 

1848
01:52:00,539 --> 01:52:04,641
no matter what situation we're in today or tomorrow
 

1849
01:52:04,641 --> 01:52:05,961
if we will look to you
 

1850
01:52:05,961 --> 01:52:08,602
you will give us the word we need.
 

1851
01:52:08,602 --> 01:52:09,742
We don't have to worry.
 

1852
01:52:09,742 --> 01:52:11,463
We don't have to prepare.
 

1853
01:52:11,463 --> 01:52:13,744
We don't have to scribble down notes.
 

1854
01:52:13,744 --> 01:52:15,664
In the hour that we need to talk
 

1855
01:52:15,664 --> 01:52:17,625
you will give us the words, Holy Spirit.
 

1856
01:52:19,006 --> 01:52:21,488
And you'll give us the decision that we need to make.
 

1857
01:52:21,488 --> 01:52:22,849
And you'll lead us and guide us.
 

1858
01:52:25,971 --> 01:52:27,473
Te amo mucho, Señor.
 

1859
01:52:28,774 --> 01:52:30,275
We love you and we praise you.
 

1860
01:52:32,417 --> 01:52:34,278
Bless the offering as the people leave.
 

1861
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:40,343
Remember the kids this week, Lord,
 

1862
01:52:40,343 --> 01:52:43,245
and our trip to the prison later on in the week.
 

1863
01:52:43,245 --> 01:52:45,126
Bless the prayer meeting coming up.
 

1864
01:52:45,126 --> 01:52:47,068
Help me to have a word for the people, Lord.
 

1865
01:52:48,431 --> 01:52:49,992
Give me a word to edify them.
 

1866
01:52:51,513 --> 01:52:55,295
We just thank you for this service, your presence here.
 

1867
01:52:58,436 --> 01:53:01,998
First-time visitors, just let everything be done
 

1868
01:53:01,998 --> 01:53:03,299
decently and in order,
 

1869
01:53:03,299 --> 01:53:04,300
Lord.
 

1870
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:05,040
Blessed by you.
 

1871
01:53:06,181 --> 01:53:09,362
For we pray in the name that's above every other name.
 

1872
01:53:11,123 --> 01:53:12,804
In Jesus' name we pray.
 

1873
01:53:14,545 --> 01:53:15,926
You can go where you want to go
 

1874
01:53:15,926 --> 01:53:17,707
if you want to sing for a little while.
 

1875
01:53:19,268 --> 01:53:22,269
Our little group up here is going to sing to the Lord.
 

1876
01:53:22,269 --> 01:53:23,190
Greet one another.
 

1877
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:40,557
Wonderful Counselor Mighty God Our Father
