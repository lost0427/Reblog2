00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:26,005
You are my joy.


190
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:30,405
You are my joy.


191
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:33,685
I will always worship you.


192
00:26:33,685 --> 00:26:37,365
I will always worship you for you.


193
00:26:38,965 --> 00:27:11,845
You are my joy into dancing.


194
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,365
You some party.


195
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,725
It's too dancing.


196
00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:32,245
Over and over and over and over again.


197
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:37,685
It's too dancing.


198
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:53,685
It's in case he holds.


199
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:53,525
Great world on his eyes.


200
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:56,085
No greater sacrifice.


201
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:32,805
I'll just come back on.


202
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:56,805
What is the sun?


203
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:02,565
What is the stones?


204
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:06,725
Of the glory and the honor to the sun.


205
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:11,525
To the stars is opportunity.


206
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:21,285
I praise God for words of the star.


207
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:34,725
Now on the throne of majesty the fathers will complete.


208
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:37,605
He raised in victory.


209
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:44,805
I do get to the tea.


210
00:33:44,805 --> 00:34:01,285
He is way too glory


211
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:04,165
and be honest to the sun.


212
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:17,365
But it's not for me.


213
00:43:50,347 --> 00:43:51,867
We sang it this morning.


214
00:43:54,107 --> 00:43:55,067
We say it.


215
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:56,027
Let's sing it again.


216
00:43:56,027 --> 00:43:58,187
We sing it in a different context.


217
00:43:59,627 --> 00:44:02,347
The Lord is a hiding place.


218
00:44:02,347 --> 00:44:06,507
And the name of this hymn is He Hideth My Soul.


219
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:10,427
Let me say what I said this morning.


220
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:13,947
Sometimes the devil attacks your mind.


221
00:44:15,627 --> 00:44:17,227
Your emotions.


222
00:44:17,227 --> 00:44:18,907
Your nerves.


223
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:20,187
Have you ever been attacked?


224
00:44:20,187 --> 00:44:22,667
Anyone here ever been attacked?


225
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:25,947
Just like the Lord has special moments for us.


226
00:44:25,947 --> 00:44:28,027
He draws near to us.


227
00:44:28,027 --> 00:44:31,627
The Bible talks about a day of evil when Satan attacks.


228
00:44:32,907 --> 00:44:34,507
And I want you to know today


229
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:39,947
my wife and I have experienced many times in the ministry attacks of the enemy.


230
00:44:41,147 --> 00:44:44,187
Give up, quit, be discouraged, whatever.


231
00:44:46,187 --> 00:44:48,587
And you have to run to the Lord.


232
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:54,827
The hiding place, the shield is the presence of the Lord in the name of Jesus.


233
00:44:56,427 --> 00:45:00,347
So my mother's favorite hymn was this song,


234
00:45:00,347 --> 00:45:04,747
He Hideth My Soul in the Cleft of the Rock.


235
00:45:04,747 --> 00:45:09,627
You know, you can get into a place in God where nothing can touch you.


236
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:12,427
How many understand what I'm talking about?


237
00:45:12,427 --> 00:45:13,787
You can get there


238
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:15,547
it doesn't matter.


239
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,147
You cast off depression


240
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,667
you cast off attacks in your mind.


241
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:21,787
You have to do it.


242
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:30,347
And uh maybe you're under attack right now.


243
00:45:30,347 --> 00:45:32,187
You could be in the choir and under attack.


244
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,347
You could be a minister and under attack.


245
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:35,547
Everybody gets attacked.


246
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:37,547
If you're a Christian, you get attacked.


247
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:38,427
Am I correct here?


248
00:45:39,547 --> 00:45:43,147
So we're in no rush to do anything here.


249
00:45:44,187 --> 00:45:46,187
We're gonna sing this hymn.


250
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:47,867
Let's stand up, everybody.


251
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:53,067
And if you're under attack right now, this week, this month, this day,


252
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:54,747
just like look, look at me.


253
00:45:54,747 --> 00:45:57,387
Just attack, attack, attack, attack.


254
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,547
Just get out of your seat and come to the front


255
00:45:59,547 --> 00:46:02,187
whether you're in the balcony or downstairs.


256
00:46:02,187 --> 00:46:05,067
We're gonna sing this song over you.


257
00:46:05,067 --> 00:46:06,507
You're not gonna quit.


258
00:46:06,507 --> 00:46:07,787
You're not gonna give up.


259
00:46:07,787 --> 00:46:11,627
You are gonna keep marching on with Jesus.


260
00:46:11,627 --> 00:46:12,427
Amen.


261
00:46:12,427 --> 00:46:13,787
Come on, let's sing it.


262
00:46:13,787 --> 00:46:14,667
Come on.


263
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:52,267
Okay, okay.


264
00:46:54,747 --> 00:47:52,907
Everybody says, Second, second.


265
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:37,787
Everybody, lift your hands up to the Lord and say wow, sick.


266
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:33,707
Let's dance up.


267
00:52:16,027 --> 00:52:17,627
Cover us.


268
00:52:17,627 --> 00:52:20,747
Protect my brothers and sisters.


269
00:52:20,747 --> 00:52:22,667
Give them the joy of the Lord


270
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:24,827
which is their strength.


271
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:27,787
Peace that passes all understanding.


272
00:52:27,787 --> 00:52:32,907
Satan, we resist you in the mighty name of Jesus.


273
00:52:32,907 --> 00:52:34,507
We know who you are


274
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:38,507
but we point you to the cross


275
00:52:38,507 --> 00:52:40,587
where Jesus died for us


276
00:52:40,587 --> 00:52:42,187
and to the empty grave


277
00:52:42,187 --> 00:52:44,667
where he rose from the dead.


278
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:46,587
He conquered you then


279
00:52:46,587 --> 00:52:48,907
he conquers you now.


280
00:52:48,907 --> 00:52:52,347
In the strong and mighty name of our Savior.


281
00:52:52,347 --> 00:52:55,867
We will rejoice in the Lord always


282
00:52:55,867 --> 00:52:58,427
and again we will rejoice.


283
00:52:58,427 --> 00:53:00,507
For we pray it in Jesus' name.


284
00:53:02,267 --> 00:53:06,427
And everyone said Amen.


285
00:53:06,427 --> 00:53:12,667
I just came down from the mezzanine lobby just as uh you were singing


286
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:16,107
uh how whatever that third song you were singing.


287
00:53:16,107 --> 00:53:22,027
Uh because from the end of the nine o'clock service I've been signing the book.


288
00:53:22,027 --> 00:53:24,027
My book Jesus Every Day.


289
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:28,507
It's really, I know I'm gonna it sounds weird.


290
00:53:28,507 --> 00:53:29,707
I hate to even say this


291
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,467
but it's really a good book.


292
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:33,787
I can't I can't believe I wrote it.


293
00:53:33,787 --> 00:53:37,067
It's really it's a hundred-day devotional.


294
00:53:37,067 --> 00:53:38,427
And today, uh no


295
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:39,467
in the last three days


296
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:43,867
I got a text from two ministers who told me I can't put your devotional down.


297
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:46,507
One said I'm reading two at a time


298
00:53:46,507 --> 00:53:49,467
even though you're supposed to read just one for the day.


299
00:53:49,467 --> 00:53:51,067
I get no money from this.


300
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:53,947
All pro proceeds go to the church.


301
00:53:53,947 --> 00:53:56,827
Uh so I'm not hawking my book for personal reasons.


302
00:53:58,107 --> 00:54:00,987
But you live ever you live your life one day at a time.


303
00:54:02,267 --> 00:54:02,827
Look at me.


304
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:06,507
Stop thinking about yesterday and who said, she said, he said


305
00:54:06,507 --> 00:54:07,947
and what happened yesterday.


306
00:54:07,947 --> 00:54:09,627
You can't change it.


307
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:11,547
Why be anxious about tomorrow?


308
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:12,507
That's called worry


309
00:54:12,507 --> 00:54:13,787
and God forbids it.


310
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:15,307
Don't worry about a single thing.


311
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:18,747
But give it to the Lord.


312
00:54:18,747 --> 00:54:21,067
But today is the day, and many people


313
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:22,107
some of you here


314
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:24,267
you're messing up your every your life


315
00:54:24,267 --> 00:54:29,787
because you're you're living in the past with regret, bitterness, resentment, unforgiveness.


316
00:54:29,787 --> 00:54:30,507
Oh, yeah.


317
00:54:30,507 --> 00:54:33,067
You can spend the rest of your life doing that.


318
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:34,667
Or you're worried about the future


319
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:37,467
and you let the only day you have today


320
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:40,587
today is the only day you live today.


321
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:42,827
Can I get an amen for that, please?


322
00:54:42,827 --> 00:54:43,867
Today, Sunday.


323
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,187
You don't have Saturday, it's gone.


324
00:54:46,187 --> 00:54:47,627
Don't talk about Monday.


325
00:54:47,627 --> 00:54:52,427
No, no, monna is Possible, impossible.


326
00:54:52,427 --> 00:54:53,867
Maso menu.


327
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:56,747
So uh Today is the day.


328
00:54:56,747 --> 00:55:00,107
So I wrote this book, Hundred Devotions, short


329
00:55:00,107 --> 00:55:03,787
that you get a little nugget of encouragement for every day.


330
00:55:03,787 --> 00:55:06,667
Somebody could use a little spiritual vitamin for every day.


331
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:07,467
Amen?


332
00:55:07,467 --> 00:55:09,467
That's all this is.


333
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:16,907
And um coming in uh I was here two weeks ago.


334
00:55:16,907 --> 00:55:17,627
You know what?


335
00:55:17,627 --> 00:55:19,627
I gotta get another job or something.


336
00:55:19,627 --> 00:55:23,947
I gotta get another way of no matter what you do


337
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:26,587
sometimes you set people off.


338
00:55:26,587 --> 00:55:29,147
So two weeks ago here I said


339
00:55:29,147 --> 00:55:31,227
you know what Tyndale, the publisher


340
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:36,187
said by the way


341
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:39,067
uh Target picked up your book.


342
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:40,747
And from December to March


343
00:55:40,747 --> 00:55:44,267
they're gonna have it in the Target stores around the country.


344
00:55:44,267 --> 00:55:46,427
That never happened to me before.


345
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,267
I don't know how it happened, why it happened.


346
00:55:48,267 --> 00:55:49,707
I take it as a blessing from God.


347
00:55:49,707 --> 00:55:51,787
More people can buy the book, right?


348
00:55:51,787 --> 00:55:54,107
All in favor, say aye.


349
00:55:54,107 --> 00:55:55,707
No, there's someone out there


350
00:55:55,707 --> 00:55:57,547
I know you're watching.


351
00:55:57,547 --> 00:56:00,587
Uh you're uh you're not happy


352
00:56:00,587 --> 00:56:02,427
because before I got to the airport


353
00:56:02,427 --> 00:56:05,307
where I had to go to for a commitment


354
00:56:05,307 --> 00:56:08,347
I uh I got uh an email saying


355
00:56:08,347 --> 00:56:09,467
I've been watching


356
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:11,707
and I used to live in New York


357
00:56:11,707 --> 00:56:13,787
and and I heard you announce


358
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,627
that your book's gonna be in Target.


359
00:56:15,627 --> 00:56:18,107
You should be ashamed your book is in Target.


360
00:56:18,107 --> 00:56:23,787
Don't you know there are leaders in the LGBTQW XYZ movement and all of that?


361
00:56:23,787 --> 00:56:25,947
And you should be ashamed of that.


362
00:56:29,707 --> 00:56:31,067
How would I know that?


363
00:56:32,107 --> 00:56:34,347
And maybe someone who goes in there could buy it


364
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:36,907
and find Jesus as their savior.


365
00:56:36,907 --> 00:56:38,747
Am I correct here or not?


366
00:56:40,907 --> 00:56:44,667
If the Muslims want to sell it, I say amen.


367
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:45,147
Right?


368
00:56:45,147 --> 00:56:46,987
Buddhists, I don't care if you want to sell it


369
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,067
because I know what it says in it.


370
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:51,307
Oh, this person lit into me.


371
00:56:52,427 --> 00:56:53,947
And then ended like this.


372
00:56:53,947 --> 00:56:55,387
And that, and you don't know that


373
00:56:55,387 --> 00:56:56,827
and that you should be ashamed.


374
00:56:56,827 --> 00:56:58,827
And by the way, blessings, bye.


375
00:57:00,347 --> 00:57:03,067
You can't make these things up.


376
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:04,427
You can ask my wife.


377
00:57:04,427 --> 00:57:05,547
We weren't even at the airport.


378
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,867
I was there, whack, whack, whack.


379
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:09,067
But praise God.


380
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:11,147
Praise God.


381
00:57:11,147 --> 00:57:13,627
So I'm gonna be up there signing and the book.


382
00:57:13,627 --> 00:57:14,827
You know what people did?


383
00:57:14,827 --> 00:57:16,827
Some people were buying five or six books.


384
00:57:16,827 --> 00:57:18,667
And I would I said, Why?


385
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:22,667
No, this is a Christmas present gonna be sending it to some people in Trinidad


386
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:24,107
, this, that, the other.


387
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,227
So however you want to do it, get one, get whatever.


388
00:57:27,227 --> 00:57:28,667
If you don't want me to sign it


389
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:30,987
I sign it and I give one of my favorite verses.


390
00:57:30,987 --> 00:57:34,107
Doesn't mean anything, uh nothing special.


391
00:57:34,107 --> 00:57:35,227
I'm the one special


392
00:57:35,227 --> 00:57:36,587
but if that means something to you


393
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:38,107
I'd love to meet you out there.


394
00:57:38,107 --> 00:57:41,387
Did you know while we're on this subject?


395
00:57:41,387 --> 00:57:42,747
I met some amazing people.


396
00:57:42,747 --> 00:57:45,387
We have amazing people in this church like you.


397
00:57:46,907 --> 00:57:48,107
The choir is gone


398
00:57:48,107 --> 00:57:53,147
but something remarkable happened this morning.


399
00:57:53,147 --> 00:57:58,347
You know that second song that I got up what he's done what he's done.


400
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:14,187
She said she started to sing the song.


401
00:58:15,307 --> 00:58:18,987
And when she came to the words that he died for me or something


402
00:58:18,987 --> 00:58:22,107
she broke she couldn't sing it


403
00:58:22,107 --> 00:58:23,307
she put her hand up like that.


404
00:58:24,347 --> 00:58:25,947
We were all listening, you know.


405
00:58:27,627 --> 00:58:30,747
The choir, the the congregation sensed it.


406
00:58:30,747 --> 00:58:32,587
You're so perceptive


407
00:58:32,587 --> 00:58:34,267
you're so kind.


408
00:58:34,267 --> 00:58:37,227
They they sensed what was happening


409
00:58:37,227 --> 00:58:39,467
and some started to cheer for her


410
00:58:39,467 --> 00:58:40,587
and she couldn't sing


411
00:58:40,587 --> 00:58:41,467
so they picked it up


412
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:44,347
and they started singing her verse.


413
00:58:44,347 --> 00:58:46,827
I never saw anything like that in my life.


414
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:50,347
And the choir was ooh and doing their ooze


415
00:58:50,347 --> 00:58:51,627
and the church was singing


416
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:52,827
and she was like, No


417
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:54,827
I can't do this.


418
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:58,427
It was so beautiful, it affected people.


419
00:58:58,427 --> 00:59:01,947
So I met someone up there who I signed a book for, and I asked


420
00:59:01,947 --> 00:59:03,787
Where are you from and all of that?


421
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:08,187
And uh, this person was an usher or works with the children


422
00:59:08,187 --> 00:59:09,307
I'm not sure.


423
00:59:09,307 --> 00:59:11,067
I said, Where do you live?


424
00:59:11,067 --> 00:59:12,507
She said, Upstate New York.


425
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,707
I said, What?


426
00:59:13,707 --> 00:59:15,467
I said, Yeah, I live in upstate New York.


427
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:18,667
Probably an hour and a half from here.


428
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:20,747
And you usher here, and you do,


429
00:59:20,747 --> 00:59:21,387
oh yeah.


430
00:59:21,387 --> 00:59:23,867
I used to live in Pennsylvania.


431
00:59:23,867 --> 00:59:25,467
And you came here every Sunday.


432
00:59:25,467 --> 00:59:25,867
Oh yeah,


433
00:59:25,867 --> 00:59:27,067
it's my ministry.


434
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:29,307
It's where God sent me.


435
00:59:29,307 --> 00:59:31,227
And we have problems, what?


436
00:59:31,227 --> 00:59:34,107
30 minutes away, 20 minutes away.


437
00:59:34,107 --> 00:59:36,587
I have to walk 250 steps from where I live


438
00:59:36,587 --> 00:59:37,627
and sometimes I'm going


439
00:59:37,627 --> 00:59:38,747
I don't know about this.


440
00:59:38,747 --> 00:59:40,187
I can't do that.


441
00:59:40,187 --> 00:59:42,667
What a what a shame.


442
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:44,187
We got some wonderful people.


443
00:59:44,187 --> 00:59:45,867
Let's thank God for the body of Christ.


444
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:47,467
Everyone, just clap your hand.


445
00:59:51,227 --> 00:59:51,947
Remember that.


446
00:59:53,147 --> 00:59:57,787
So just to give this report, Angola, prison, Louisiana State Penitentiary


447
00:59:57,787 --> 01:00:00,827
for those of you visiting, 4,200 inmates.


448
01:00:00,827 --> 01:00:03,707
Average sentence is 91 years.


449
01:00:03,707 --> 01:00:09,227
Only murderers, double offenders, murder first degree, murder second degree.


450
01:00:10,427 --> 01:00:13,547
There's people on death row who have been in death row for 10 years.


451
01:00:13,547 --> 01:00:15,307
They're appealing and appealing.


452
01:00:15,307 --> 01:00:17,947
Some other serious felons, but 91 years.


453
01:00:19,067 --> 01:00:21,707
So we've been going there for years.


454
01:00:21,707 --> 01:00:25,387
And I made a visit recently with the singers


455
01:00:25,387 --> 01:00:27,547
a traveling group that Carol selected.


456
01:00:27,547 --> 01:00:29,387
Carol and I were there.


457
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:32,347
We met people we knew from other visits


458
01:00:32,347 --> 01:00:37,644
and um They had a beautiful meeting as you'll see, and I spoke.


459
01:00:37,644 --> 01:00:39,484
So I got it in my heart.


460
01:00:39,484 --> 01:00:45,084
Forty two hundred let's send forty two hundred boxes to the inmates for Christmas.


461
01:00:46,524 --> 01:00:55,084
Soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, a pair of socks, and maybe a New Testament.


462
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,484
So Pastor Eric Prez is working on it


463
01:00:57,484 --> 01:00:58,684
putting it all together.


464
01:00:58,684 --> 01:01:00,204
How many think that's a good idea?


465
01:01:00,204 --> 01:01:01,724
Say amen.


466
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,684
Because the Christians there will be blessed.


467
01:01:04,684 --> 01:01:08,364
They say there's almost a thousand now Christians there in the prison


468
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,284
because of what God's doing.


469
01:01:10,284 --> 01:01:15,484
And um and uh the ones who are not believers


470
01:01:15,484 --> 01:01:16,364
they'll receive this.


471
01:01:16,364 --> 01:01:17,164
They'll say, why?


472
01:01:17,164 --> 01:01:18,524
What am I getting this for?


473
01:01:18,524 --> 01:01:20,124
And then the guys who are in there


474
01:01:20,124 --> 01:01:23,164
who are like inmate chaplains, inmate pastors


475
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:24,924
they can really minister.


476
01:01:24,924 --> 01:01:28,524
So we guessed it's like $80,000, $90,000.


477
01:01:28,524 --> 01:01:29,804
He's still getting the numbers.


478
01:01:29,804 --> 01:01:31,724
We're getting we gotta figure it out.


479
01:01:31,724 --> 01:01:33,564
So I didn't I had it in my heart.


480
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,604
I told the Lord, Lord


481
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:37,244
I don't want to steal from the church and they're giving


482
01:01:37,244 --> 01:01:39,324
because we have other things that are going on.


483
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:41,084
So God somehow provide.


484
01:01:41,084 --> 01:01:42,444
And just this past week


485
01:01:42,444 --> 01:01:43,804
or in the last 10 days


486
01:01:43,804 --> 01:01:48,444
someone who was at our conference a few weeks ago from Sarasota, Florida


487
01:01:48,444 --> 01:01:53,724
just called and said, Whatever it costs, shipping, everything, the bags


488
01:01:53,724 --> 01:01:55,084
they can't have a box.


489
01:01:55,084 --> 01:01:57,244
We found out we can't give them a box


490
01:01:57,244 --> 01:02:01,164
because the prison has to see what's what you're giving them in each box.


491
01:02:01,164 --> 01:02:06,764
So it has to be a plastic bag that you can see through.


492
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,764
And uh we're gonna get that.


493
01:02:08,764 --> 01:02:12,284
And the person said, Whatever it costs, 80,000, 90,000, whatever


494
01:02:12,284 --> 01:02:13,884
we'll pay for the whole thing.


495
01:02:13,884 --> 01:02:15,644
And we thank God for that.


496
01:02:15,644 --> 01:02:17,564
Come on, can we thank God for that?


497
01:02:17,564 --> 01:02:19,164
That's the Lord.


498
01:02:19,164 --> 01:02:20,524
That is the Lord.


499
01:02:20,524 --> 01:02:23,804
And those watching, and in case you're watching, thank you.


500
01:02:23,804 --> 01:02:24,604
Thank you.


501
01:02:24,604 --> 01:02:26,364
Thank you, really thank you.


502
01:02:26,364 --> 01:02:29,484
So this was quite a visit that we had here.


503
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:31,324
So uh just watch us


504
01:02:31,324 --> 01:02:34,044
make it loud so they can hear that music, brother.


505
01:04:02,204 --> 01:04:03,404
That beautiful.


506
01:04:05,164 --> 01:04:08,044
And when you remember people like that and give


507
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,484
whether they're Christians or not


508
01:04:09,484 --> 01:04:10,604
when you give to them


509
01:04:10,604 --> 01:04:12,684
God is gonna bless us as a church.


510
01:04:12,684 --> 01:04:14,044
How many believe that?


511
01:04:14,044 --> 01:04:15,884
Lift your hand if you believe that.


512
01:04:15,884 --> 01:04:18,444
If we bless people in prison


513
01:04:18,444 --> 01:04:20,444
it doesn't matter what crimes they committed.


514
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:21,884
There, but for the grace of God


515
01:04:21,884 --> 01:04:23,964
we all could be in prison.


516
01:04:23,964 --> 01:04:25,644
So we bless them


517
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:27,964
God will help us and bless us.


518
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,404
And I want to remind you


519
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:30,764
we need your giving.


520
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:32,604
Those we we missed online


521
01:04:32,604 --> 01:04:35,964
the online went down for the nine o'clock service.


522
01:04:35,964 --> 01:04:39,164
I'm saying to all of you and to you there, um


523
01:04:39,164 --> 01:04:41,564
please help us by giving online


524
01:04:41,564 --> 01:04:44,364
or as you leave the building, they have baskets.


525
01:04:45,644 --> 01:04:51,884
And sometimes it takes special gifts that God puts on your heart to get things accomplished.


526
01:04:51,884 --> 01:04:57,084
And um we got one that God put in our hearts


527
01:04:57,084 --> 01:04:58,524
especially my wife's heart


528
01:04:58,524 --> 01:05:03,244
and that's for the Roma people who are over in Slovakia.


529
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:05,244
Among people who they don't want to hire them


530
01:05:05,244 --> 01:05:06,764
they won't let their kids go to school


531
01:05:06,764 --> 01:05:09,724
it's just the worst prejudice you could imagine.


532
01:05:09,724 --> 01:05:12,844
Um to build that God is doing something


533
01:05:12,844 --> 01:05:14,524
but they have no money.


534
01:05:14,524 --> 01:05:17,244
And uh to build a church over there


535
01:05:17,244 --> 01:05:21,164
where in all of Europe it would be the largest Roma gypsy


536
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:22,924
but that's not a good word.


537
01:05:22,924 --> 01:05:26,764
Uh biggest Roma church in all of Europe it could be.


538
01:05:26,764 --> 01:05:29,484
And uh when you bless people who don't have


539
01:05:29,484 --> 01:05:31,564
you get such a joy, amen?


540
01:05:31,564 --> 01:05:32,444
For wait a minute


541
01:05:32,444 --> 01:05:34,684
I read that somewhere for it is more blessed


542
01:05:34,684 --> 01:05:40,124
to the culture says, gimme, gimme, gimme, more, more, more.


543
01:05:40,124 --> 01:05:42,924
And God says, give, give, give.


544
01:05:42,924 --> 01:05:45,164
And your blessings will increase.


545
01:05:45,164 --> 01:05:45,964
How?


546
01:05:45,964 --> 01:05:46,764
I don't know


547
01:05:46,764 --> 01:05:48,124
but he'll do it.


548
01:05:48,124 --> 01:05:49,484
He can't lie.


549
01:05:49,484 --> 01:05:49,884
Amen?


550
01:05:55,324 --> 01:06:00,284
Some while ago I talked to someone I can't remember the the exact relationship


551
01:06:00,284 --> 01:06:02,444
, the mother or the mother-in-law.


552
01:06:02,444 --> 01:06:05,084
But it almost happened, I believe, to my sister-in-law,


553
01:06:05,084 --> 01:06:09,804
but in this case, the mother, the mother-in-law elderly,


554
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:15,244
not you know, real um quick thinking at that age


555
01:06:17,404 --> 01:06:21,484
was contacted by somebody who started to say


556
01:06:21,484 --> 01:06:24,524
I uh I handle your investment portfolio


557
01:06:25,724 --> 01:06:29,324
or a banking or financial advisor.


558
01:06:29,324 --> 01:06:32,604
And uh I calling because I want to help you.


559
01:06:32,604 --> 01:06:36,524
If you just strategically move your accounts around


560
01:06:36,524 --> 01:06:39,324
uh you could get a much better rate than you're getting now.


561
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:42,044
And within 20 minutes


562
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:43,164
when they told her, okay


563
01:06:43,164 --> 01:06:43,724
it's all set


564
01:06:43,724 --> 01:06:47,004
now just press send, she lost everything.


565
01:06:51,324 --> 01:06:53,004
How many scams are there out there?


566
01:06:54,364 --> 01:06:56,924
Are we not getting warned every day?


567
01:06:56,924 --> 01:06:58,924
How many of you are called


568
01:06:58,924 --> 01:07:02,284
and if you don't know the number that you see, don't pick up the phone.


569
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:03,244
Lift your hand.


570
01:07:04,924 --> 01:07:06,364
I called a minister the other day


571
01:07:06,364 --> 01:07:07,404
he asked me to call him


572
01:07:07,404 --> 01:07:08,364
and now when I called him


573
01:07:08,364 --> 01:07:09,484
he didn't pick up twice


574
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,804
and then I knew he didn't recognize my number.


575
01:07:11,804 --> 01:07:13,484
I had to text him and say it's me.


576
01:07:13,484 --> 01:07:15,564
Remember, you asked me to call you?


577
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,724
And because everyone's on guard.


578
01:07:17,724 --> 01:07:18,044
Why?


579
01:07:18,044 --> 01:07:19,404
There's so much deception.


580
01:07:19,404 --> 01:07:21,164
The culture is built on deception.


581
01:07:23,564 --> 01:07:28,684
Everything is deception, not hardly anything is as it seems.


582
01:07:28,684 --> 01:07:29,804
I'm thinking back to


583
01:07:29,804 --> 01:07:34,284
when I we rented Radio City Music Hall for three years to do outreaches.


584
01:07:35,324 --> 01:07:40,124
And I got to know the manager, uh the stage manager, biggest stage in the world.


585
01:07:40,124 --> 01:07:43,644
You can't go out on that stage unless you pass by him


586
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:45,884
he tells you you can go.


587
01:07:45,884 --> 01:07:48,364
When the spotlight is on the stage


588
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:50,444
where you're supposed to go


589
01:07:50,444 --> 01:07:52,044
you can hardly see it.


590
01:07:52,044 --> 01:07:55,564
I once walked out there and I was groping, praying, Oh God, please


591
01:07:55,564 --> 01:07:58,364
I don't want to spend the rest of my life walking on this stage.


592
01:07:58,364 --> 01:08:00,044
I gotta find where I'm supposed to go.


593
01:08:00,044 --> 01:08:02,844
And I saw a little glimmer on the ground on the floor


594
01:08:02,844 --> 01:08:04,684
and I went to it.


595
01:08:04,684 --> 01:08:06,284
But he said to me, You know


596
01:08:06,284 --> 01:08:09,244
I've been watching your wife in the choir.


597
01:08:09,244 --> 01:08:10,604
And the stage hands too


598
01:08:10,604 --> 01:08:12,604
and I know they curse like sailors.


599
01:08:13,724 --> 01:08:18,284
And but they're toning it down during the rehearsals because you know what


600
01:08:18,284 --> 01:08:21,644
uh you people seem to be real.


601
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:22,604
I said, Well, thank you


602
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:23,324
that's a compliment.


603
01:08:23,324 --> 01:08:24,924
He said, No, listen


604
01:08:24,924 --> 01:08:28,124
I've been working here for 10, 15 years.


605
01:08:28,124 --> 01:08:31,244
You don't know what I deal with with these entertainers.


606
01:08:32,524 --> 01:08:37,564
They use language that make our stage hands blush.


607
01:08:40,204 --> 01:08:41,244
And they're cursing


608
01:08:41,244 --> 01:08:43,484
they curse the crowd, big entertainers.


609
01:08:43,484 --> 01:08:45,164
I can name somebody mentioned to me


610
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:47,084
you would all know the name.


611
01:08:47,084 --> 01:08:49,324
He said, and then when their announcement is made


612
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:50,524
and ladies and gentlemen


613
01:08:50,524 --> 01:08:55,644
let's welcome they totally transform into another human thing.


614
01:08:56,684 --> 01:09:00,524
And they seduce the whole audience.


615
01:09:00,524 --> 01:09:03,804
And when their act is over and they're walking off


616
01:09:03,804 --> 01:09:06,284
whether they sing or they're comedians or whatever


617
01:09:06,284 --> 01:09:09,164
they're cursing before they even clear the curtain


618
01:09:09,164 --> 01:09:11,884
they're cursing the audience.


619
01:09:11,884 --> 01:09:13,724
The foulest language.


620
01:09:13,724 --> 01:09:18,444
And everyone's paying and buying their stuff and thinking they know them


621
01:09:18,444 --> 01:09:20,684
they don't know them at all.


622
01:09:20,684 --> 01:09:22,524
They're vile people, a lot of them.


623
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:24,844
He told me a couple that were more genuine.


624
01:09:24,844 --> 01:09:26,924
But he says, I have to deal with that every night.


625
01:09:26,924 --> 01:09:28,124
I hear they're cursing


626
01:09:28,124 --> 01:09:29,644
they're lay at me


627
01:09:29,644 --> 01:09:31,084
they're mad at everyone.


628
01:09:32,444 --> 01:09:33,484
And then they he said


629
01:09:33,484 --> 01:09:34,124
I'm telling you


630
01:09:34,124 --> 01:09:36,284
it's like a transformation.


631
01:09:36,284 --> 01:09:37,004
Deception.


632
01:09:40,364 --> 01:09:44,124
It's very hard to find sincerity anywhere.


633
01:09:44,124 --> 01:09:51,244
In other words, uh all that glitters is not even in church


634
01:09:51,244 --> 01:09:55,004
how people act to you and act or preachers.


635
01:09:55,004 --> 01:09:56,764
That's not who they are.


636
01:09:56,764 --> 01:09:59,084
They could be a totally other person.


637
01:09:59,084 --> 01:10:01,804
But they've learned the act of deception.


638
01:10:01,804 --> 01:10:04,124
Now it's a big scam now


639
01:10:04,124 --> 01:10:11,164
but it actually relates back to the original scammer, the original deceiver, who is Satan.


640
01:10:11,164 --> 01:10:14,044
Satan is a liar from the beginning, the Bible says.


641
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:15,724
Jesus said that.


642
01:10:15,724 --> 01:10:19,884
And he he's the master of deception.


643
01:10:19,884 --> 01:10:23,564
When Satan attacks, there's two ways he attacks.


644
01:10:23,564 --> 01:10:25,964
He does on a frontal assault


645
01:10:25,964 --> 01:10:28,844
which is just what we were praying against.


646
01:10:28,844 --> 01:10:32,444
Frontal assault, discouragement, depression


647
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:35,484
uh uh just attacking your mind


648
01:10:35,484 --> 01:10:37,644
where you you think you can't take it anymore


649
01:10:37,644 --> 01:10:39,804
and you just know this is not of God


650
01:10:39,804 --> 01:10:40,444
this is the devil.


651
01:10:42,364 --> 01:10:43,804
He has another way though.


652
01:10:43,804 --> 01:10:46,044
He doesn't want to do frontal assaults all the time.


653
01:10:47,884 --> 01:10:51,244
He sneaks around and he deceives.


654
01:10:51,244 --> 01:10:52,844
He comes like a friend.


655
01:10:52,844 --> 01:10:56,364
He sends people into your life who are not what they seem.


656
01:10:56,364 --> 01:10:58,764
Just like God sends people into my life


657
01:10:58,764 --> 01:10:59,564
my wife's life


658
01:10:59,564 --> 01:11:01,004
who have been a great blessing


659
01:11:01,004 --> 01:11:02,844
Satan sends people too.


660
01:11:02,844 --> 01:11:03,404
What do you think?


661
01:11:03,404 --> 01:11:04,844
He doesn't have control of people.


662
01:11:06,444 --> 01:11:07,884
And they're not what they seem


663
01:11:07,884 --> 01:11:09,004
and they're a trap.


664
01:11:10,364 --> 01:11:14,844
They're sent by Satan to trap us, to hurt us.


665
01:11:14,844 --> 01:11:18,844
The classic example of this, of course, goes back to the Garden of Eden


666
01:11:18,844 --> 01:11:21,884
where the serpent came and pretended to,


667
01:11:21,884 --> 01:11:25,164
you know, be fighting for the rights of Adam and Eve.


668
01:11:25,164 --> 01:11:26,844
No, you should eat of that tree


669
01:11:26,844 --> 01:11:28,684
because God knows if you eat of that


670
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,924
you'll know you'll be just like a god.


671
01:11:30,924 --> 01:11:32,364
So I'm here to help you.


672
01:11:32,364 --> 01:11:33,644
He wasn't here to help them


673
01:11:33,644 --> 01:11:34,604
he's here to destroy them.


674
01:11:36,684 --> 01:11:43,484
And there could be people situations right now going on that uh Satan is it's a setup.


675
01:11:43,484 --> 01:11:50,284
So let's say this is the map of Israel, north-south


676
01:11:50,284 --> 01:11:52,844
it's longer than it is wide.


677
01:11:52,844 --> 01:11:53,884
Here's the north


678
01:11:53,884 --> 01:11:55,564
there's the south.


679
01:11:55,564 --> 01:11:57,724
Further south is the desert


680
01:11:57,724 --> 01:12:02,204
where the Israelites spent 40 years after they came out of Egypt as slaves.


681
01:12:02,204 --> 01:12:05,004
Forty years they wandered because of their unbelief


682
01:12:05,004 --> 01:12:08,044
and now they came up, look, along this side


683
01:12:08,044 --> 01:12:13,164
and this running the whole length almost of Israel is the Jordan River.


684
01:12:13,164 --> 01:12:17,164
So they came up on the east side of the Jordan River


685
01:12:17,164 --> 01:12:22,844
and Moses now died and turned the reins over, leadership over to Joshua.


686
01:12:22,844 --> 01:12:25,724
Joshua's one of the great names in the Old Testament.


687
01:12:25,724 --> 01:12:29,324
And now cross over the river and possess the land.


688
01:12:29,324 --> 01:12:33,564
I've promised this land to your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.


689
01:12:33,564 --> 01:12:36,924
But there's people there that you have to drive out, destroy.


690
01:12:36,924 --> 01:12:38,684
I've watched and waited


691
01:12:38,684 --> 01:12:40,044
they will not repent.


692
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:43,404
Their religion is an abomination.


693
01:12:43,404 --> 01:12:45,964
What they do to their children is an abomination.


694
01:12:45,964 --> 01:12:47,564
I'm bringing judgment on them.


695
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:48,764
I'm using you.


696
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:50,844
So go and possess the land.


697
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:54,284
Do not spare anyone and don't make treaties with them.


698
01:12:54,284 --> 01:12:56,524
And don't intermarry with them.


699
01:12:56,524 --> 01:12:58,124
Because you will not convert them


700
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,644
they will convert you.


701
01:12:59,644 --> 01:13:01,404
So have nothing to do with them.


702
01:13:01,404 --> 01:13:03,084
You're a separate people.


703
01:13:03,084 --> 01:13:08,284
That's the word meaning of the word holy or sanctified, separated to God.


704
01:13:08,284 --> 01:13:10,684
So they crossed the river


705
01:13:10,684 --> 01:13:14,524
and the first battle they fought was the Battle of Jericho


706
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:16,284
and the walls came.


707
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:18,604
There you go.


708
01:13:20,284 --> 01:13:24,284
So after the Battle of Jericho


709
01:13:24,284 --> 01:13:25,804
which they were victorious


710
01:13:25,804 --> 01:13:31,404
they fought a battle against a smaller place called Ai, the letter A, the letter I,


711
01:13:31,404 --> 01:13:33,484
and after a little problem there


712
01:13:33,484 --> 01:13:35,644
they they won that battle.


713
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:39,644
And now they were going to go out and possess the land.


714
01:13:39,644 --> 01:13:42,844
But all if you could just take that child out or hold the child


715
01:13:42,844 --> 01:13:45,324
it'll not distract me and the people.


716
01:13:45,324 --> 01:13:46,444
Thank you.


717
01:13:46,444 --> 01:13:56,124
So what happened was the tribes around them that were in the land, Hivites, Jebusites, Amorites


718
01:13:56,124 --> 01:13:58,204
they they heard what had happened.


719
01:13:58,204 --> 01:14:01,484
And now they got together, some of them, and said, Look


720
01:14:01,484 --> 01:14:02,764
let's form an alliance.


721
01:14:02,764 --> 01:14:03,804
We don't like each other


722
01:14:03,804 --> 01:14:06,204
but let's for this get together


723
01:14:06,204 --> 01:14:11,004
because we gotta stand against these Hebrews, these Israelites.


724
01:14:11,004 --> 01:14:14,284
So that was force against force.


725
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:18,444
Joshua 9 says it like this.


726
01:14:18,444 --> 01:14:21,884
Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things,


727
01:14:21,884 --> 01:14:25,404
the kings in the hill country, in the western foothills,


728
01:14:25,404 --> 01:14:29,644
and along the entire coast of the Mediterranean Sea as far as Lebanon


729
01:14:29,644 --> 01:14:30,924
that's up in the north,


730
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:37,484
the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.


731
01:14:37,484 --> 01:14:41,964
They came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel.


732
01:14:41,964 --> 01:14:44,124
So here's your classic picture.


733
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:49,564
We have Israel with God leading them


734
01:14:49,564 --> 01:14:51,724
walking into where God sends them


735
01:14:51,724 --> 01:14:53,084
and now people are gonna say


736
01:14:54,124 --> 01:14:55,404
we're gonna fight you


737
01:14:55,404 --> 01:15:00,204
we're gonna stand against you, force against force, and more numbers


738
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,724
numbers make for strength


739
01:15:01,724 --> 01:15:03,324
so they're going to say


740
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:07,724
we're gonna align ourselves with each other so we can defeat them.


741
01:15:07,724 --> 01:15:13,964
But not all the tribes who lived in that land wanted to just go head to head.


742
01:15:13,964 --> 01:15:18,844
Satan has plan B. So let's read about it.


743
01:15:18,844 --> 01:15:26,764
So, however, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai


744
01:15:26,764 --> 01:15:28,684
those first two battles


745
01:15:28,684 --> 01:15:35,164
they resorted to a ruse, to deception.


746
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:39,884
The word there means a lie, a deception, a scam.


747
01:15:41,164 --> 01:15:43,484
They ran something against them.


748
01:15:44,764 --> 01:15:50,044
Now Gibeon was only like ten miles north of what would become Jerusalem


749
01:15:50,044 --> 01:15:52,924
so they were right in that territory.


750
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:55,884
They were those people that were to be driven out


751
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,564
and have nothing to do with them.


752
01:15:57,564 --> 01:15:59,884
God had told Joshua that.


753
01:15:59,884 --> 01:16:02,524
But listen to what they did.


754
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:09,324
They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded with worn-out sacks


755
01:16:09,324 --> 01:16:13,884
and old wineskins, cracked and mended.


756
01:16:13,884 --> 01:16:17,884
They put worn and patched sandals on their feet.


757
01:16:17,884 --> 01:16:20,524
They wore old clothes.


758
01:16:20,524 --> 01:16:24,764
All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.


759
01:16:25,804 --> 01:16:30,684
Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him, and the Israelites


760
01:16:30,684 --> 01:16:32,764
We have come from a distant country.


761
01:16:32,764 --> 01:16:34,524
Make a treaty with us.


762
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:40,284
The Israelites said to the Hives, by the way, those the word for Hivite


763
01:16:40,284 --> 01:16:41,884
there in the Hebrew, Hebrew


764
01:16:41,884 --> 01:16:44,604
the root means interestingly, snake.


765
01:16:44,604 --> 01:16:45,484
Serpent.


766
01:16:45,484 --> 01:16:46,604
Notice in the Bible


767
01:16:46,604 --> 01:16:50,684
the Bible says Satan pictures two things.


768
01:16:50,684 --> 01:16:54,684
The lion, Satan goes about like a roaring lion


769
01:16:54,684 --> 01:16:56,044
and then he's a snake


770
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,884
he's a serpent.


771
01:16:57,884 --> 01:16:58,604
Right?


772
01:16:58,604 --> 01:17:00,524
So notice, lion head on


773
01:17:00,524 --> 01:17:02,364
I'm gonna crush your skull.


774
01:17:02,364 --> 01:17:07,724
Serpent, no, I'm gonna come a little sideways on you.


775
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:10,684
So those were the Hivites.


776
01:17:10,684 --> 01:17:14,364
But perhaps you live near us, the Israelites said.


777
01:17:14,364 --> 01:17:17,564
How can we make a treaty with you?


778
01:17:17,564 --> 01:17:19,804
We are your servants.


779
01:17:19,804 --> 01:17:21,244
What are you talking about?


780
01:17:21,244 --> 01:17:23,244
Don't get excited.


781
01:17:23,244 --> 01:17:24,844
We've come a long way.


782
01:17:26,044 --> 01:17:28,044
They've been traveling for 45 minutes.


783
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:29,964
No, we've come a long way.


784
01:17:29,964 --> 01:17:31,404
Don't you see the sandals?


785
01:17:31,404 --> 01:17:33,164
Don't you see everything?


786
01:17:33,164 --> 01:17:36,844
And look, we're your servant.


787
01:17:36,844 --> 01:17:37,964
We want to help you.


788
01:17:37,964 --> 01:17:40,684
Everybody needs a helping hand in life.


789
01:17:40,684 --> 01:17:41,964
We're your servant.


790
01:17:43,404 --> 01:17:45,724
They said to Joshua, but Joshua asked


791
01:17:45,724 --> 01:17:48,444
Who are you and where do you come from?


792
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:49,884
And they were good at this.


793
01:17:49,884 --> 01:17:55,564
They answered, Your servants have come from a very distant country.


794
01:17:55,564 --> 01:17:57,724
Because of the fame of the Lord your God


795
01:17:57,724 --> 01:17:59,564
for we have heard reports of him


796
01:17:59,564 --> 01:18:02,124
all that he did in Egypt


797
01:18:02,124 --> 01:18:05,964
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan,


798
01:18:05,964 --> 01:18:07,404
Sihon, king of Heshbon,


799
01:18:07,404 --> 01:18:09,644
and Ag, king of Bashan


800
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:11,644
who reigned in Ashtaroth.


801
01:18:11,644 --> 01:18:13,084
We heard about all that.


802
01:18:13,084 --> 01:18:16,204
And our elders and all those living in our country said to us


803
01:18:16,204 --> 01:18:18,044
Take provisions for your journey.


804
01:18:18,044 --> 01:18:19,964
Go and meet them and say to them


805
01:18:19,964 --> 01:18:21,244
We are your servants.


806
01:18:21,244 --> 01:18:23,084
Notice, make a treaty with us.


807
01:18:23,084 --> 01:18:27,004
Come on, just let's let's let's let's get along.


808
01:18:27,004 --> 01:18:27,644
Come on.


809
01:18:28,764 --> 01:18:30,204
We come a long way.


810
01:18:30,204 --> 01:18:31,564
We don't want trouble.


811
01:18:33,804 --> 01:18:35,804
This bread of ours was warm


812
01:18:35,804 --> 01:18:37,884
when we packed it at home.


813
01:18:40,844 --> 01:18:43,084
On the day that we left to come to you.


814
01:18:43,084 --> 01:18:45,884
But now, look, see how dry and moldy it is.


815
01:18:47,964 --> 01:18:51,164
And those wineskins that we filled were new.


816
01:18:51,164 --> 01:18:53,004
But see how cracked they are.


817
01:18:53,004 --> 01:18:59,484
And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very hold that long journey, hold that.


818
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:03,244
So the way they traveled back then is they took animal hair


819
01:19:03,244 --> 01:19:08,924
and they made what we would call like suitcases or packing crates


820
01:19:08,924 --> 01:19:10,524
but it wasn't wood.


821
01:19:10,524 --> 01:19:12,604
It was this these big sacks


822
01:19:12,604 --> 01:19:14,204
and they would put their stuff in it


823
01:19:14,204 --> 01:19:17,324
and both sides would be on either side of the donkey.


824
01:19:17,324 --> 01:19:19,804
And they made that really old and all of that.


825
01:19:19,804 --> 01:19:21,884
And they took another kind of animal skin


826
01:19:21,884 --> 01:19:23,964
and put uh back in that day


827
01:19:23,964 --> 01:19:25,884
they put wine there in that.


828
01:19:25,884 --> 01:19:29,644
It saved the wine better than other possibilities.


829
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:33,004
So when they showed it to is it look


830
01:19:33,004 --> 01:19:34,604
look at look how old this stuff is.


831
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:36,204
And look at our sandals.


832
01:19:37,724 --> 01:19:39,324
Look at these shoes.


833
01:19:40,364 --> 01:19:42,444
This is not Amazon Prime.


834
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:46,284
This is just this is some old stuff that we have.


835
01:19:46,284 --> 01:19:47,324
Right?


836
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:49,724
So you know why it looks old?


837
01:19:49,724 --> 01:19:52,684
Because we've been traveling so far.


838
01:19:52,684 --> 01:19:53,644
Check it out.


839
01:19:53,644 --> 01:19:55,004
Look at the bread.


840
01:19:55,004 --> 01:19:58,764
The bread just came out of the oven when we left.


841
01:19:58,764 --> 01:20:00,124
Just came out of the oven.


842
01:20:00,124 --> 01:20:01,004
And now look at it.


843
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:02,604
It's hard like a rock.


844
01:20:04,844 --> 01:20:06,844
I just gotta say this quick.


845
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:08,444
How many remember the day


846
01:20:08,444 --> 01:20:12,844
when supermarkets would have a section of day-old food?


847
01:20:14,284 --> 01:20:16,204
Raise your hand if you remember that.


848
01:20:16,204 --> 01:20:17,884
No, most most of you don't.


849
01:20:17,884 --> 01:20:19,884
But there was so A and P


850
01:20:19,884 --> 01:20:20,764
which was back there


851
01:20:20,764 --> 01:20:22,444
my when I was 10, 11, 12


852
01:20:22,444 --> 01:20:25,084
my mother would send me Eastern European


853
01:20:25,084 --> 01:20:27,244
wanting to save as much as she can.


854
01:20:27,244 --> 01:20:30,044
Jim, Jimmy, go and buy this and buy that


855
01:20:30,044 --> 01:20:31,964
and buy this on Floppish Avenue, right?


856
01:20:31,964 --> 01:20:32,844
Parkside Avenue.


857
01:20:32,844 --> 01:20:33,804
That's where I was.


858
01:20:39,048 --> 01:20:46,408
And go to the day old section to get some day old bread because it's 30% cheaper.


859
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:50,088
So I didn't know


860
01:20:50,088 --> 01:20:51,048
I didn't think of this.


861
01:20:51,048 --> 01:20:52,088
But one day I went


862
01:20:52,088 --> 01:20:54,008
and I took the day old bread


863
01:20:54,008 --> 01:20:55,768
and I felt it.


864
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:59,368
And I hit the counter with it.


865
01:20:59,368 --> 01:21:02,008
And it like almost cracked the counter.


866
01:21:03,528 --> 01:21:05,848
And I had no cell phones


867
01:21:05,848 --> 01:21:06,568
but I was thinking


868
01:21:06,568 --> 01:21:10,968
this is just year old bread, not just day old bread.


869
01:21:12,488 --> 01:21:14,568
But I had to be an obedient son


870
01:21:14,568 --> 01:21:16,248
so I brought it back.


871
01:21:16,248 --> 01:21:17,608
That's how their bread was.


872
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,048
Moldy hard.


873
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:22,888
Just as proof.


874
01:21:22,888 --> 01:21:24,568
We've been traveling so long.


875
01:21:24,568 --> 01:21:26,568
This this thing was right out of the oven.


876
01:21:26,568 --> 01:21:27,448
Look at it now.


877
01:21:28,568 --> 01:21:31,368
So now we read.


878
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:36,568
Ah, that's the killer verse.


879
01:21:36,568 --> 01:21:40,088
The Israelites sampled their provisions


880
01:21:40,088 --> 01:21:43,368
but did not inquire of the Lord.


881
01:21:43,368 --> 01:21:45,448
They checked out the sandals


882
01:21:45,448 --> 01:21:47,288
they checked out the bread


883
01:21:47,288 --> 01:21:50,328
and they used their head, their brain.


884
01:21:50,328 --> 01:21:54,168
They checked out everything they talked about, the clothes


885
01:21:54,168 --> 01:21:56,168
everything looked dusty and all.


886
01:21:56,168 --> 01:22:02,248
The one thing they forgot to do was ask the Lord what was going on.


887
01:22:02,248 --> 01:22:05,448
Did you know you're not as smart as the devil?


888
01:22:05,448 --> 01:22:06,648
Look at me, young man.


889
01:22:06,648 --> 01:22:07,448
Look at me, sir.


890
01:22:07,448 --> 01:22:08,328
Look at me, ma'am.


891
01:22:09,368 --> 01:22:12,888
The devil's trying to run a game on all of us


892
01:22:12,888 --> 01:22:14,728
and you cannot outthink him.


893
01:22:15,768 --> 01:22:17,128
You're only how old?


894
01:22:17,128 --> 01:22:19,448
He's been forever just about.


895
01:22:19,448 --> 01:22:20,888
He has experience.


896
01:22:20,888 --> 01:22:21,848
He knows you.


897
01:22:21,848 --> 01:22:23,448
He knows me.


898
01:22:23,448 --> 01:22:26,168
He knows how to run deception.


899
01:22:26,168 --> 01:22:28,568
And what looks good is not good.


900
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:30,248
That road that looks so good


901
01:22:30,248 --> 01:22:32,008
it could lead to destruction.


902
01:22:32,008 --> 01:22:33,928
But he doesn't have a big sign.


903
01:22:33,928 --> 01:22:36,408
Follow this to hell.


904
01:22:36,408 --> 01:22:38,008
Follow this to destruction.


905
01:22:38,008 --> 01:22:38,968
Of course he doesn't.


906
01:22:38,968 --> 01:22:40,248
He says, follow this


907
01:22:40,248 --> 01:22:42,408
and you'll be happier than you've ever been.


908
01:22:43,928 --> 01:22:48,728
So they tested everything


909
01:22:48,728 --> 01:22:51,128
but they didn't ask the Lord.


910
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:58,568
And finally, then Joshua made a treaty of peace.


911
01:22:58,568 --> 01:23:02,888
There's hardly anything in the Bible wrong about Joshua.


912
01:23:02,888 --> 01:23:04,088
But here's one.


913
01:23:04,088 --> 01:23:06,808
He made a treaty of peace with them to let them live


914
01:23:06,808 --> 01:23:10,648
and the leaders of the assembly ratified it with a seal.


915
01:23:10,648 --> 01:23:12,248
So you know what that means?


916
01:23:12,248 --> 01:23:13,528
A few days later


917
01:23:13,528 --> 01:23:16,168
some people came to Joshua and said, Yo


918
01:23:16,168 --> 01:23:18,168
you know the people we made a treaty with?


919
01:23:18,168 --> 01:23:19,688
They're not from a far country


920
01:23:19,688 --> 01:23:21,608
they're from down the street.


921
01:23:23,608 --> 01:23:25,288
And the people heard about that


922
01:23:25,288 --> 01:23:27,288
and realized that they had been deceived


923
01:23:27,288 --> 01:23:30,248
and the people got in a big huff and went and said


924
01:23:30,248 --> 01:23:32,648
Let's attack and kill them, those Gibeonites.


925
01:23:32,648 --> 01:23:34,488
And Joshua and the leader said, We can't.


926
01:23:34,488 --> 01:23:36,488
We swore to God before we'd said


927
01:23:36,488 --> 01:23:37,528
that we wouldn't attack them.


928
01:23:37,528 --> 01:23:38,888
We signed a treaty.


929
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:41,848
And now for the rest of the time in the Old Testament


930
01:23:41,848 --> 01:23:44,248
they are going to be a thorn in their flesh


931
01:23:44,248 --> 01:23:47,128
and be a problem that they didn't have to be


932
01:23:47,128 --> 01:23:49,048
but it's because they acted


933
01:23:49,048 --> 01:23:54,248
and got deceived without asking the Lord what was really going on.


934
01:23:54,248 --> 01:23:58,008
You know, that guy that seems so nice, ma'am


935
01:23:58,008 --> 01:24:00,248
he might not be that nice.


936
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,248
And guys, I know she's fine, I know that


937
01:24:06,248 --> 01:24:08,968
but let's go a little deeper than that, okay?


938
01:24:08,968 --> 01:24:09,928
Then she's fine.


939
01:24:11,288 --> 01:24:13,288
Did you ask God about that relationship?


940
01:24:14,968 --> 01:24:16,248
Well, you think he doesn't care?


941
01:24:17,528 --> 01:24:19,128
Of course he does.


942
01:24:19,128 --> 01:24:20,968
He might save you from a lot of trouble.


943
01:24:20,968 --> 01:24:22,728
I've been duped.


944
01:24:22,728 --> 01:24:24,968
Have you not ever been duped?


945
01:24:24,968 --> 01:24:26,168
What someone you look at me


946
01:24:26,168 --> 01:24:27,608
you've never been fooled by things?


947
01:24:28,968 --> 01:24:29,528
Of course.


948
01:24:29,528 --> 01:24:32,408
We're so limited in our intelligence unless you're proud


949
01:24:32,408 --> 01:24:35,608
and think you're that smart and hip.


950
01:24:35,608 --> 01:24:38,808
No, Satan's I've been at this game way longer than you and me.


951
01:24:40,568 --> 01:24:43,448
They tested everything by using their brains


952
01:24:43,448 --> 01:24:46,408
and they forgot there's something better than brains.


953
01:24:46,408 --> 01:24:48,328
There's God.


954
01:24:48,328 --> 01:24:50,408
And he knows everything.


955
01:24:50,408 --> 01:24:52,968
He knows the beginning and the end.


956
01:24:52,968 --> 01:24:55,448
He knows what's real and not real.


957
01:24:56,968 --> 01:25:00,408
So the Gibeonites did not say we're gonna fight 'em.


958
01:25:00,408 --> 01:25:02,408
And notice what they asked for.


959
01:25:02,408 --> 01:25:03,928
They just asked for, look.


960
01:25:06,488 --> 01:25:08,088
Let's just get along.


961
01:25:11,688 --> 01:25:14,168
Let's just live together.


962
01:25:14,168 --> 01:25:18,568
But God had said there's certain things you can't live together with.


963
01:25:18,568 --> 01:25:21,688
Can I tell you something, sir, up in the balcony?


964
01:25:21,688 --> 01:25:24,888
Bad company corrupts morals.


965
01:25:24,888 --> 01:25:27,848
Have you asked God about those friends you're getting so close to


966
01:25:27,848 --> 01:25:30,408
or worse going into business with?


967
01:25:30,408 --> 01:25:32,968
What fellowship does light have with darkness?


968
01:25:32,968 --> 01:25:35,848
I'm not talking about living on a hill in a monastery.


969
01:25:35,848 --> 01:25:38,408
I'm talking about being a normal human being here.


970
01:25:38,408 --> 01:25:42,008
But you gotta be very careful of what associations you make.


971
01:25:43,048 --> 01:25:46,728
And who you date and who you marry and who you hang with.


972
01:25:48,008 --> 01:25:49,368
We're to love everyone


973
01:25:49,368 --> 01:25:51,448
and to share Christ with everyone


974
01:25:51,448 --> 01:25:53,368
but we can't be with everyone


975
01:25:53,368 --> 01:25:55,608
or they're gonna have an effect on us.


976
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:58,968
Look, just like God sends people into our lives


977
01:25:58,968 --> 01:26:01,848
Satan sends people into our lives.


978
01:26:01,848 --> 01:26:03,368
He has control over people


979
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:05,368
like God has control over people.


980
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:10,968
I look back on my life, so just recounting to Carol how certain people


981
01:26:10,968 --> 01:26:12,968
, I missed them, my father-in-law


982
01:26:12,968 --> 01:26:15,048
how God sent him into my life


983
01:26:15,048 --> 01:26:16,968
and what he meant has meant to me


984
01:26:16,968 --> 01:26:20,968
and then other friends I had in the ministry who took an interest in me.


985
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:22,488
They were life changers


986
01:26:22,488 --> 01:26:25,368
but Satan has people too.


987
01:26:25,368 --> 01:26:28,328
Not everything that glitters is gold.


988
01:26:28,328 --> 01:26:31,448
And you can't tell a book by its cover.


989
01:26:31,448 --> 01:26:33,208
But my book has a nice cover.


990
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:35,128
When you go up there, no


991
01:26:35,128 --> 01:26:36,328
what did I just say?


992
01:26:36,328 --> 01:26:39,048
I ruined this whole thing.


993
01:26:39,048 --> 01:26:41,368
And my book has a nice cover


994
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:42,248
but it's really good.


995
01:26:42,248 --> 01:26:43,928
Read it, it's good.


996
01:26:43,928 --> 01:26:46,248
That's a bad example.


997
01:26:46,248 --> 01:26:47,688
So, but let's be real.


998
01:26:47,688 --> 01:26:48,328
Let's be real


999
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:49,768
let's do real talk.


1000
01:26:51,768 --> 01:26:55,448
So, you and I know we live in Brooklyn, a lot of us.


1001
01:26:55,448 --> 01:26:58,648
And well, if you live and grow up in Brooklyn


1002
01:26:58,648 --> 01:27:02,168
if someone walks up to you like they would do in other states and says


1003
01:27:02,168 --> 01:27:03,368
How y'all doing?


1004
01:27:03,368 --> 01:27:04,408
Good morning.


1005
01:27:04,408 --> 01:27:05,688
If you do that in Brooklyn


1006
01:27:05,688 --> 01:27:06,808
you reach for your wallet


1007
01:27:06,808 --> 01:27:09,128
and just put your hand on it and go, wait a minute


1008
01:27:09,128 --> 01:27:10,888
that wallet is there.


1009
01:27:10,888 --> 01:27:12,168
Am I right or wrong?


1010
01:27:14,408 --> 01:27:16,168
Well, I you I don't know you.


1011
01:27:16,168 --> 01:27:18,488
Why are you saying good morning to me?


1012
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:20,968
It's a different mentality here.


1013
01:27:20,968 --> 01:27:23,288
But there's a lot of scam artists.


1014
01:27:23,288 --> 01:27:26,168
So let's just establish this as we close.


1015
01:27:26,168 --> 01:27:27,928
There's such a thing as deception


1016
01:27:27,928 --> 01:27:29,848
and Satan is the master of it


1017
01:27:29,848 --> 01:27:33,528
and part of spiritual warfare is not just fighting back


1018
01:27:33,528 --> 01:27:36,728
and praying back against forces against you


1019
01:27:36,728 --> 01:27:41,208
it's being wise and discerning enough to spot a scam.


1020
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:44,328
So?


1021
01:27:46,008 --> 01:27:49,528
Look at what Paul says to a church in Corinth


1022
01:27:49,528 --> 01:27:51,368
where he had started this church.


1023
01:27:51,368 --> 01:27:56,088
Anyone you forgive, this guy had been sleeping in 1 Corinthians, he mentions it.


1024
01:27:56,088 --> 01:27:58,328
This man had to be put out of the church.


1025
01:27:58,328 --> 01:28:02,408
He was unrepentant about sleeping with his own stepmother.


1026
01:28:02,408 --> 01:28:03,528
And Paul said, No


1027
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:04,728
you've got to put him out of the church.


1028
01:28:04,728 --> 01:28:06,088
He's unrepentant.


1029
01:28:06,088 --> 01:28:09,128
He could contaminate the other people.


1030
01:28:09,128 --> 01:28:10,808
But now the guy had repented


1031
01:28:10,808 --> 01:28:14,168
and when someone repents and is meet and means it


1032
01:28:14,168 --> 01:28:16,968
you forgive him and you try to restore people.


1033
01:28:16,968 --> 01:28:19,208
God is not interested in burying people


1034
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:21,688
he's interested in saving people.


1035
01:28:21,688 --> 01:28:23,528
So now Paul says, Look


1036
01:28:23,528 --> 01:28:25,368
if I also forgive that person


1037
01:28:25,368 --> 01:28:26,648
and what I forgive in


1038
01:28:26,648 --> 01:28:27,848
if there's anything to forgive


1039
01:28:27,848 --> 01:28:31,448
I forgive in the sight of Christ for your sake.


1040
01:28:31,448 --> 01:28:35,048
In order that Satan might not out with us


1041
01:28:35,048 --> 01:28:36,968
for we are not aware


1042
01:28:36,968 --> 01:28:40,488
for we are not unaware of his what?


1043
01:28:40,488 --> 01:28:41,128
Scheme.


1044
01:28:42,568 --> 01:28:45,768
Not his power, his scheme.


1045
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,248
He's a schemer.


1046
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:51,208
He works stuff.


1047
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:58,168
He'll send friends into your into your children's life that are messengers of Satan.


1048
01:29:02,328 --> 01:29:04,328
All friends are not equal for your children.


1049
01:29:04,328 --> 01:29:06,568
Am I correct or not?


1050
01:29:06,568 --> 01:29:09,288
Some might be wanting them to try drugs.


1051
01:29:09,288 --> 01:29:10,968
What are you going to do about that?


1052
01:29:12,088 --> 01:29:14,648
So we have to be careful.


1053
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:18,168
He goes on, though, and says


1054
01:29:18,168 --> 01:29:21,768
not only does Satan have schemes, Satan


1055
01:29:21,768 --> 01:29:27,528
in his scheming and deception, goes right into the ministry and into spiritual things.


1056
01:29:28,568 --> 01:29:30,408
So there's fake pastors


1057
01:29:30,408 --> 01:29:31,288
there's real pastors


1058
01:29:31,288 --> 01:29:32,728
there's fake pastors.


1059
01:29:32,728 --> 01:29:37,048
There's real men of God, women of God, there's fake.


1060
01:29:37,048 --> 01:29:39,768
2 Corinthians 11.


1061
01:29:39,768 --> 01:29:41,928
For such people are false apostles.


1062
01:29:41,928 --> 01:29:43,928
You mean someone could call themselves an apostle


1063
01:29:43,928 --> 01:29:47,528
and wear a robe and a turnaround collar and be totally false?


1064
01:29:47,528 --> 01:29:49,128
Absolutely.


1065
01:29:49,128 --> 01:29:51,368
Or they could be a true man of God.


1066
01:29:52,568 --> 01:29:54,568
It's just not that simple.


1067
01:29:56,248 --> 01:29:58,728
Also, there are deceitful workers.


1068
01:29:58,728 --> 01:29:59,688
Oh, they're working


1069
01:29:59,688 --> 01:30:01,048
but they're liars.


1070
01:30:01,048 --> 01:30:02,568
They're working for their own good.


1071
01:30:02,568 --> 01:30:03,448
They want your money.


1072
01:30:03,448 --> 01:30:05,528
They don't care about your soul.


1073
01:30:05,528 --> 01:30:07,288
They want your adulation.


1074
01:30:07,288 --> 01:30:10,888
They want to be able to claim you as their following.


1075
01:30:10,888 --> 01:30:12,808
They're not interested in you


1076
01:30:12,808 --> 01:30:14,648
and Christ and your walk with him.


1077
01:30:14,648 --> 01:30:17,368
They masquerade as apostles of Christ.


1078
01:30:17,368 --> 01:30:18,808
So Halloween's coming up.


1079
01:30:18,808 --> 01:30:21,288
The world's going to celebrate that, right?


1080
01:30:21,288 --> 01:30:22,888
So what do people do?


1081
01:30:22,888 --> 01:30:23,928
They wear a mask.


1082
01:30:23,928 --> 01:30:25,528
So the whole point of the mask is


1083
01:30:25,528 --> 01:30:26,728
you don't know who I am.


1084
01:30:26,728 --> 01:30:28,248
All you see is the mask.


1085
01:30:28,248 --> 01:30:30,408
And he said, the preachers are like that.


1086
01:30:30,408 --> 01:30:32,488
These people taking advantage of you


1087
01:30:32,488 --> 01:30:34,088
they're wearing a mask.


1088
01:30:34,088 --> 01:30:35,128
They're not real.


1089
01:30:37,448 --> 01:30:39,688
Why are you looking at me that way?


1090
01:30:39,688 --> 01:30:40,808
That's not in the Bible


1091
01:30:40,808 --> 01:30:42,088
or is it in the Bible?


1092
01:30:42,088 --> 01:30:42,968
I'm asking you


1093
01:30:42,968 --> 01:30:44,008
is it in the Bible?


1094
01:30:46,168 --> 01:30:50,168
Masquerading as apostles of Christ.


1095
01:30:50,168 --> 01:30:51,368
And no wonder.


1096
01:30:51,368 --> 01:30:52,088
Aha.


1097
01:30:52,088 --> 01:30:55,768
For Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.


1098
01:30:55,768 --> 01:30:59,208
Satan isn't walking around with a dark thing on and horns.


1099
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:02,088
Are you thinking he's stupid?


1100
01:31:02,088 --> 01:31:03,528
When he comes after us


1101
01:31:03,528 --> 01:31:08,888
he can masquerade as a preacher, as an angel of light, as a dream in the night


1102
01:31:08,888 --> 01:31:10,888
as a light shining in your room


1103
01:31:10,888 --> 01:31:14,008
and now you know you're gonna follow that light wherever it leads you.


1104
01:31:14,008 --> 01:31:17,768
Don't follow it until you make sure it's of God or not of God.


1105
01:31:19,688 --> 01:31:22,168
Oh, I know, but the merchant preacher said Jesus.


1106
01:31:22,168 --> 01:31:23,128
I listened.


1107
01:31:23,128 --> 01:31:24,888
Demons say Jesus.


1108
01:31:25,928 --> 01:31:27,528
Jesus, get away from us.


1109
01:31:27,528 --> 01:31:29,288
We know who you are, they said.


1110
01:31:30,888 --> 01:31:33,768
So ministers don't fake ministers


1111
01:31:33,768 --> 01:31:35,608
these kinds that Paul's talking about.


1112
01:31:35,608 --> 01:31:38,408
They don't wear signs saying I am fake.


1113
01:31:38,408 --> 01:31:41,448
They come real, they look real.


1114
01:31:41,448 --> 01:31:43,928
They're like the Gibeonites, the bread


1115
01:31:43,928 --> 01:31:45,608
the whole thing looks good


1116
01:31:45,608 --> 01:31:47,528
but it's not.


1117
01:31:47,528 --> 01:31:48,808
Two ways, by the way


1118
01:31:48,808 --> 01:31:51,928
you can tell about them is number one


1119
01:31:51,928 --> 01:31:54,568
they're usually going to end up looking for your money


1120
01:31:54,568 --> 01:31:56,808
and talking about money all the time.


1121
01:31:56,808 --> 01:31:58,488
Watch, always look for that.


1122
01:31:58,488 --> 01:32:03,608
And number two, they're gonna lift themselves up in front of you as somebody special.


1123
01:32:03,608 --> 01:32:05,448
It won't be so much about Jesus.


1124
01:32:05,448 --> 01:32:07,208
Some of them won't even mention Jesus.


1125
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:09,688
My wife just told me her sister was at a funeral


1126
01:32:09,688 --> 01:32:12,728
and at the funeral, a minister officiated.


1127
01:32:12,728 --> 01:32:16,088
How would you do a funeral for 40 minutes


1128
01:32:16,088 --> 01:32:18,728
and never mention the name of Jesus once?


1129
01:32:18,728 --> 01:32:20,488
No, how would you do that?


1130
01:32:20,488 --> 01:32:23,448
God, Lord, but that could mean anything.


1131
01:32:23,448 --> 01:32:24,728
That doesn't offend people.


1132
01:32:24,728 --> 01:32:26,408
You know what offends people?


1133
01:32:26,408 --> 01:32:27,848
Jesus.


1134
01:32:27,848 --> 01:32:29,288
Let me know what I'm talking about.


1135
01:32:29,288 --> 01:32:30,328
Just lift your hand.


1136
01:32:30,328 --> 01:32:32,408
That's where it sets hell off.


1137
01:32:32,408 --> 01:32:35,848
All hell breaks loose when you say Jesus.


1138
01:32:38,088 --> 01:32:39,848
Demons do not cower


1139
01:32:39,848 --> 01:32:45,688
and we don't have authority when we say, Creator of the universe, God of all truth.


1140
01:32:45,688 --> 01:32:47,288
Those are all true.


1141
01:32:47,288 --> 01:32:50,968
But the name that's above every name is the name of Jesus.


1142
01:32:50,968 --> 01:32:53,208
So they will play down Jesus


1143
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:54,488
or they will produce


1144
01:32:54,488 --> 01:32:56,408
we learned that from 2 Corinthians


1145
01:32:56,408 --> 01:32:58,808
they'll produce another Jesus to you.


1146
01:32:58,808 --> 01:33:00,568
Not the one Paul told you about.


1147
01:33:00,568 --> 01:33:02,248
He says in that same context


1148
01:33:02,248 --> 01:33:04,328
I don't have the verse up, he says


1149
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:06,568
you've received Jesus from these characters


1150
01:33:06,568 --> 01:33:08,488
but not the Jesus I told you about.


1151
01:33:08,488 --> 01:33:10,248
No, no, no, no.


1152
01:33:10,248 --> 01:33:10,728
No.


1153
01:33:10,728 --> 01:33:12,088
Not the Jesus I told you.


1154
01:33:13,128 --> 01:33:16,328
There's a white Jesus, conservative right-wing Jesus


1155
01:33:16,328 --> 01:33:17,768
there's a black Jesus


1156
01:33:17,768 --> 01:33:20,168
there's a Puerto Rican Jesus


1157
01:33:20,168 --> 01:33:23,928
eating baccalaito after the meeting or something.


1158
01:33:28,328 --> 01:33:32,408
There's uh the all-American Jesus, you know, blonde


1159
01:33:32,408 --> 01:33:36,248
and things any place for an NFL team or something.


1160
01:33:36,248 --> 01:33:38,728
There's the there's the prosperity Jesus.


1161
01:33:38,728 --> 01:33:40,968
All he's interested in is getting you more money.


1162
01:33:40,968 --> 01:33:42,088
Come on.


1163
01:33:42,088 --> 01:33:44,088
Am I kidding or am I telling the truth?


1164
01:33:44,088 --> 01:33:46,488
There's a hundred Jesuses out there.


1165
01:33:46,488 --> 01:33:48,808
So how do you know who's the real one?


1166
01:33:48,808 --> 01:33:52,408
How do you know who's the one who can save your soul from hell


1167
01:33:52,408 --> 01:33:54,808
and have your sins forgiven?


1168
01:33:54,808 --> 01:33:57,128
That's why he's talking about that.


1169
01:33:57,128 --> 01:34:00,808
And Jesus said, as the time goes on, I close.


1170
01:34:00,808 --> 01:34:02,088
As time goes on


1171
01:34:02,088 --> 01:34:03,208
it's not gonna get better


1172
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:04,488
it's gonna get worse.


1173
01:34:04,488 --> 01:34:06,648
Pastor Simba, I didn't come to hear that.


1174
01:34:06,648 --> 01:34:08,968
Okay, I'll tell you a lie.


1175
01:34:08,968 --> 01:34:11,208
Uh it's gonna get great now.


1176
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:12,088
Do you want a lie


1177
01:34:12,088 --> 01:34:14,168
or do you want the truth?


1178
01:34:14,168 --> 01:34:14,808
Okay.


1179
01:34:14,808 --> 01:34:16,808
Here's what Jesus said, not me.


1180
01:34:16,808 --> 01:34:21,448
Talking about the end times, Jesus said, Matthew 24.


1181
01:34:21,448 --> 01:34:25,368
Then you'll be handed over to be persecuted and put to death


1182
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:26,728
and you'll be hated.


1183
01:34:26,728 --> 01:34:31,608
Hold that for a second there, Joy, by all nations because of me.


1184
01:34:31,608 --> 01:34:36,728
How would you recruit to have followers with that sentence?


1185
01:34:36,728 --> 01:34:40,488
Follow me, everyone, because you'll be persecuted


1186
01:34:40,488 --> 01:34:42,168
and you'll be put to death


1187
01:34:42,168 --> 01:34:43,928
and you'll be hated by everyone


1188
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:45,608
so come and follow me.


1189
01:34:47,368 --> 01:34:49,208
Our American concept is no


1190
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:49,848
don't say that.


1191
01:34:49,848 --> 01:34:51,928
If you want followers, tell them anything


1192
01:34:51,928 --> 01:34:53,208
but don't tell them that.


1193
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:54,248
But Jesus said, No


1194
01:34:54,248 --> 01:34:56,088
I gotta tell you the truth.


1195
01:34:56,088 --> 01:34:58,248
But if you he that endures to the end


1196
01:34:58,248 --> 01:34:59,768
the same shall be saved.


1197
01:34:59,768 --> 01:35:03,368
And I'll take you home to be with me and forever.


1198
01:35:03,368 --> 01:35:06,568
So Jesus goes on and says


1199
01:35:06,568 --> 01:35:09,048
At that time many will turn away from the faith


1200
01:35:09,048 --> 01:35:11,608
and will betray and hate each other.


1201
01:35:11,608 --> 01:35:14,488
So the falling away will be people hating,


1202
01:35:14,488 --> 01:35:18,808
and a few, just a couple false prophets, will appear.


1203
01:35:18,808 --> 01:35:20,568
No, many.


1204
01:35:20,568 --> 01:35:23,768
And will deceive many people.


1205
01:35:27,128 --> 01:35:29,448
Why would the Lord let that happen?


1206
01:35:29,448 --> 01:35:32,808
It's the nature of life on earth.


1207
01:35:36,888 --> 01:35:39,208
At that time, if anyone says to you, look


1208
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:40,248
here's the Messiah


1209
01:35:40,248 --> 01:35:41,368
or there he is


1210
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:42,728
do not believe it.


1211
01:35:43,848 --> 01:35:51,528
For false messiahs, false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive impossible.


1212
01:35:51,528 --> 01:35:52,488
Even the elect.


1213
01:35:52,488 --> 01:35:53,688
What is that false?


1214
01:35:53,688 --> 01:35:55,208
Wait a minute, what does that mean?


1215
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:59,048
They will perform great signs and wonders to deceive.


1216
01:35:59,048 --> 01:36:02,328
So there are people who, for a miracle, will run anywhere.


1217
01:36:02,328 --> 01:36:04,088
I've been around that since I was a kid.


1218
01:36:04,088 --> 01:36:06,728
Anywhere there's a supposed healing or a miracle


1219
01:36:06,728 --> 01:36:08,168
they're gonna run, give their money


1220
01:36:08,168 --> 01:36:10,808
follow the guy no matter what he preaches.


1221
01:36:10,808 --> 01:36:13,048
No matter how he abusive he is.


1222
01:36:13,048 --> 01:36:14,888
No, there was a miracle.


1223
01:36:14,888 --> 01:36:17,128
Well, we know God does miracles


1224
01:36:17,128 --> 01:36:20,488
but there's another kind of miracle that you have to be careful of.


1225
01:36:20,488 --> 01:36:22,488
It's not whether the guy was healed.


1226
01:36:22,488 --> 01:36:25,688
The question is, what's the sermon after the healing?


1227
01:36:25,688 --> 01:36:28,728
Because unless it's the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ


1228
01:36:28,728 --> 01:36:30,168
we have to say away with you.


1229
01:36:30,168 --> 01:36:32,568
Come on, can we say amen to that?


1230
01:36:38,008 --> 01:36:43,048
Most people turn, a lot of people turn into miracle mongerers.


1231
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:46,648
They just run after some sensational sign.


1232
01:36:46,648 --> 01:36:48,008
What's the guy saying?


1233
01:36:48,008 --> 01:36:49,208
What's his spirit like?


1234
01:36:49,208 --> 01:36:52,088
Oh, I don't care, but ooh, look what happened.


1235
01:36:54,968 --> 01:36:57,288
So we can't downplay God's power.


1236
01:36:57,288 --> 01:36:58,008
God is real.


1237
01:36:58,008 --> 01:36:59,928
How many believe God can do miracles?


1238
01:36:59,928 --> 01:37:00,808
Amen.


1239
01:37:00,808 --> 01:37:06,968
But it seems as if there's signs and wonders of another kind.


1240
01:37:08,008 --> 01:37:12,888
So they tested everything


1241
01:37:12,888 --> 01:37:15,128
but they didn't inquire of the Lord.


1242
01:37:17,288 --> 01:37:19,288
So what's the point?


1243
01:37:19,288 --> 01:37:21,688
The point is there's deception.


1244
01:37:21,688 --> 01:37:24,008
Satan is masterful at it.


1245
01:37:24,008 --> 01:37:28,808
Number two, what the goal of it was, just make a treaty.


1246
01:37:28,808 --> 01:37:32,808
Just put up with that stuff in your life, Jeffrey, if you come.


1247
01:37:32,808 --> 01:37:34,728
Just keep that friendship going.


1248
01:37:34,728 --> 01:37:38,968
You know you have no business talking to that person like you're talking to them.


1249
01:37:38,968 --> 01:37:40,008
That's inappropriate.


1250
01:37:40,008 --> 01:37:41,448
You know that.


1251
01:37:41,448 --> 01:37:44,648
But Satan's gonna say, listen, don't get carried away.


1252
01:37:44,648 --> 01:37:45,928
No one's perfect.


1253
01:37:48,328 --> 01:37:49,528
He's a master at that.


1254
01:37:49,528 --> 01:37:50,648
He's a master preacher.


1255
01:37:55,128 --> 01:37:56,808
Why did they get fooled?


1256
01:37:56,808 --> 01:37:58,968
Because they depended they depended


1257
01:37:58,968 --> 01:38:00,568
and relied on their brain


1258
01:38:00,568 --> 01:38:03,688
and their IQ rather than oh God.


1259
01:38:03,688 --> 01:38:07,288
These people claim to be from a far, far country


1260
01:38:07,288 --> 01:38:09,128
and it looks like they are.


1261
01:38:09,128 --> 01:38:11,448
But Lord, speak to us.


1262
01:38:11,448 --> 01:38:15,688
And the Lord would have told them get them out of town


1263
01:38:15,688 --> 01:38:17,608
and save them all that trouble.


1264
01:38:17,608 --> 01:38:20,008
You know the Lord loves you, you know that, right?


1265
01:38:20,008 --> 01:38:23,368
And he wants to save us from trouble and heartache.


1266
01:38:23,368 --> 01:38:25,208
And he wants your soul saved.


1267
01:38:26,648 --> 01:38:28,728
And you could be here judging what I'm saying


1268
01:38:28,728 --> 01:38:30,808
and checking me out and all of that


1269
01:38:30,808 --> 01:38:32,088
but you're not checking me out


1270
01:38:32,088 --> 01:38:33,928
you're checking yourself out.


1271
01:38:33,928 --> 01:38:35,608
How you react to this truth


1272
01:38:35,608 --> 01:38:39,368
you're you're determining how you look at truth.


1273
01:38:39,368 --> 01:38:43,208
Either these verses are true, or then throw this book away.


1274
01:38:43,208 --> 01:38:45,208
Then Jesus is a fake.


1275
01:38:45,208 --> 01:38:47,368
Because he's the one warning us.


1276
01:38:47,368 --> 01:38:50,648
False prophets, false teachers, false


1277
01:38:50,648 --> 01:38:53,528
oh my goodness, there's fake everything.


1278
01:38:53,528 --> 01:38:56,488
The main thing is we gotta ask God to keep us true.


1279
01:38:56,488 --> 01:38:57,688
Amen.


1280
01:38:57,688 --> 01:39:00,888
And I want him to protect our church.


1281
01:39:00,888 --> 01:39:03,688
I don't want fake things in our church.


1282
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:06,008
Fake manifestations, fake preaching.


1283
01:39:06,008 --> 01:39:07,288
And if I should go off


1284
01:39:07,288 --> 01:39:10,568
and start preaching stuff that's not in this Bible, look at me.


1285
01:39:10,568 --> 01:39:13,368
Get up and walk out while I'm preaching.


1286
01:39:13,368 --> 01:39:14,568
And say, that boy


1287
01:39:14,568 --> 01:39:16,808
that fool lost his mind.


1288
01:39:16,808 --> 01:39:18,328
He lost his mind.


1289
01:39:20,968 --> 01:39:24,568
We've got to adhere to the word and to Jesus.


1290
01:39:24,568 --> 01:39:26,168
But here's, look


1291
01:39:26,168 --> 01:39:27,768
here's the last word.


1292
01:39:27,768 --> 01:39:32,168
The last word, 1 John 4, 1. Look at it.


1293
01:39:32,168 --> 01:39:33,448
Can you see it?


1294
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:38,808
Dear friends, don't believe every spirit.


1295
01:39:38,808 --> 01:39:43,048
But test the spirits to see whether they are from God


1296
01:39:43,048 --> 01:39:47,448
because many false prophets have gone out into the world.


1297
01:39:50,008 --> 01:39:51,688
Test the spirits.


1298
01:39:51,688 --> 01:39:54,008
The Holy Spirit gives discernment.


1299
01:39:54,008 --> 01:39:58,408
The Holy Spirit can produce miracles, tongues, interpretation of tongues,


1300
01:39:58,408 --> 01:40:01,128
healings, word of wisdom, word of knowledge.


1301
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:03,048
There's all kinds of things the Holy Spirit can do.


1302
01:40:03,048 --> 01:40:04,088
Read the book.


1303
01:40:04,088 --> 01:40:08,568
But one of the things he gives is discernment.


1304
01:40:08,568 --> 01:40:09,688
Discernment.


1305
01:40:09,688 --> 01:40:12,888
So that not judging everyone and being mean to people.


1306
01:40:15,448 --> 01:40:17,528
Because sometimes in our zeal


1307
01:40:17,528 --> 01:40:18,968
we treat people so mean


1308
01:40:18,968 --> 01:40:20,968
thinking we're being spiritual and we're not.


1309
01:40:20,968 --> 01:40:22,408
We're just being mean.


1310
01:40:22,408 --> 01:40:26,408
Satan hooked us by giving us a mean spirit.


1311
01:40:26,408 --> 01:40:27,928
So I'm trying, brother.


1312
01:40:27,928 --> 01:40:30,728
I'm trying as good as I can.


1313
01:40:30,728 --> 01:40:36,728
So what you have to do is ask the Holy Spirit give me discernment.


1314
01:40:38,425 --> 01:40:40,105
Don't enter into things quickly.


1315
01:40:40,105 --> 01:40:41,145
Look at me, please.


1316
01:40:41,145 --> 01:40:42,745
Look at me.


1317
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:45,305
Don't make sudden decisions.


1318
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:46,265
Pray.


1319
01:40:46,265 --> 01:40:47,065
Think.


1320
01:40:47,065 --> 01:40:48,265
Weigh it.


1321
01:40:48,265 --> 01:40:49,705
Talk to your spouse.


1322
01:40:49,705 --> 01:40:51,225
Talk to a pastor.


1323
01:40:51,225 --> 01:40:52,505
Get a prayer partner.


1324
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:54,745
Don't jump into things and then you find out,


1325
01:40:54,745 --> 01:40:56,985
oh no, they're Gibeonites.


1326
01:40:59,145 --> 01:41:01,385
Come on, have we not all been fooled?


1327
01:41:01,385 --> 01:41:03,945
How many have been taken in at least once in your life?


1328
01:41:03,945 --> 01:41:06,425
Lift your hand, okay?


1329
01:41:06,425 --> 01:41:08,265
Someone lifted up both their hands.


1330
01:41:08,265 --> 01:41:10,265
I don't know what that problem was.


1331
01:41:10,265 --> 01:41:12,505
That's that's deep.


1332
01:41:12,505 --> 01:41:14,425
There's some deep stuff there.


1333
01:41:19,145 --> 01:41:20,905
Test the spirits.


1334
01:41:20,905 --> 01:41:23,465
Do I read about this in the Bible?


1335
01:41:23,465 --> 01:41:26,505
Is that Jesus there to oh, brothers, please?


1336
01:41:26,505 --> 01:41:28,265
I plead with you now.


1337
01:41:28,265 --> 01:41:29,625
If you want me to get on my knees


1338
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:30,585
I'll get on my knees.


1339
01:41:30,585 --> 01:41:32,745
Please read your Bible every day.


1340
01:41:32,745 --> 01:41:33,545
Please.


1341
01:41:33,545 --> 01:41:36,825
Don't send me money every day.


1342
01:41:36,825 --> 01:41:39,865
Don't lift up the Brooklyn Tabernacle every day.


1343
01:41:39,865 --> 01:41:42,665
Read your Bible every day.


1344
01:41:42,665 --> 01:41:47,385
How do you know the true how do you will you know the false unless you know the true?


1345
01:41:47,385 --> 01:41:52,585
Do you know the people who work for the Treasury Department who are anti-uh counterfeiting?


1346
01:41:52,585 --> 01:41:53,625
Did you know what they do?


1347
01:41:53,625 --> 01:41:55,305
They don't study counterfeit.


1348
01:41:55,305 --> 01:41:57,625
They don't look at the counterfeit bills and say, oh


1349
01:41:57,625 --> 01:41:58,985
look what they did on that one.


1350
01:41:58,985 --> 01:42:05,065
They study every millimeter of a real dollar, of a real hundred.


1351
01:42:05,065 --> 01:42:07,225
And they know it, the color, the paper


1352
01:42:07,225 --> 01:42:08,745
they know everything about it so


1353
01:42:08,745 --> 01:42:09,865
that they know it so much


1354
01:42:09,865 --> 01:42:11,145
that if you bring a fake money,


1355
01:42:11,145 --> 01:42:12,825
they go, No, it's fake, get it out.


1356
01:42:12,825 --> 01:42:15,145
Get that money out of here because they know the real.


1357
01:42:15,145 --> 01:42:20,025
How many want to know the real Jesus, the real word of God, the real truth?


1358
01:42:20,025 --> 01:42:21,945
Come on, you have to know that.


1359
01:42:21,945 --> 01:42:23,785
I can't do that for you.


1360
01:42:25,225 --> 01:42:27,785
Women, come on Friday to hear Karen Jones.


1361
01:42:27,785 --> 01:42:29,865
Come on Tuesday to the prayer meeting.


1362
01:42:29,865 --> 01:42:32,825
I'll be leading it and exhorting you, hopefully.


1363
01:42:32,825 --> 01:42:34,585
But the point is


1364
01:42:34,585 --> 01:42:36,665
you can't live off of meetings.


1365
01:42:36,665 --> 01:42:38,265
You've got to walk with God.


1366
01:42:38,265 --> 01:42:40,265
Please walk with God.


1367
01:42:40,265 --> 01:42:42,665
Ask God for discernment.


1368
01:42:42,665 --> 01:42:47,065
If you're in some relationship now or getting close, come on out, choir singers.


1369
01:42:47,065 --> 01:42:50,825
If you're getting close to some, don't make a commitment.


1370
01:42:50,825 --> 01:42:53,305
If you're dating someone who's not a believer


1371
01:42:53,305 --> 01:42:54,745
would you please come up?


1372
01:42:54,745 --> 01:42:59,145
Just tell me up in the in the at the I'll be in the mezzanine.


1373
01:42:59,145 --> 01:43:00,665
I'll have someone pray for you


1374
01:43:00,665 --> 01:43:03,065
or I'll make an appointment.


1375
01:43:03,065 --> 01:43:04,985
Don't do that.


1376
01:43:04,985 --> 01:43:06,825
I know, but he looks so good


1377
01:43:06,825 --> 01:43:09,145
and he got a lot of money in his bank.


1378
01:43:09,145 --> 01:43:11,305
Pastor Simbal, the last guy I went out with


1379
01:43:11,305 --> 01:43:13,065
he was asking me to pay on the date.


1380
01:43:13,065 --> 01:43:15,465
I mean, uh, what's that about?


1381
01:43:15,465 --> 01:43:16,825
I got it.


1382
01:43:16,825 --> 01:43:19,065
He was broke, but he might have been a Christian.


1383
01:43:19,065 --> 01:43:20,825
There are broke Christians.


1384
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:25,305
Why are you laughing?


1385
01:43:25,305 --> 01:43:27,225
Is that true or not?


1386
01:43:27,225 --> 01:43:28,745
Is that true or not?


1387
01:43:30,025 --> 01:43:31,465
Am I true or not?


1388
01:43:31,465 --> 01:43:33,785
There's broke there's Christians who are broke.


1389
01:43:33,785 --> 01:43:35,545
They have no money.


1390
01:43:35,545 --> 01:43:36,425
They have no money.


1391
01:43:36,425 --> 01:43:37,865
Oh, this guy got a lot of money


1392
01:43:37,865 --> 01:43:40,345
but what if he's a Gibeonite?


1393
01:43:40,345 --> 01:43:42,425
No, no, I'm not going to church now


1394
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:44,345
but when I when we get married


1395
01:43:44,345 --> 01:43:47,065
uh I'll be there.


1396
01:43:47,065 --> 01:43:49,305
I mean, I know that like the back of my hand.


1397
01:43:49,305 --> 01:43:52,745
You know how many heartaches I've dealt with over these years?


1398
01:43:55,225 --> 01:43:57,385
You gotta talk to the Lord.


1399
01:43:57,385 --> 01:43:59,785
Jesus, what's going on here?


1400
01:43:59,785 --> 01:44:02,025
If you're at the crossroad making a decision


1401
01:44:02,025 --> 01:44:04,425
I plead with you and my friends behind me


1402
01:44:04,425 --> 01:44:05,465
we're pleading with you.


1403
01:44:06,985 --> 01:44:10,345
Go to God today and say, Lord, what's happening?


1404
01:44:10,345 --> 01:44:12,425
What's really what is this really all about?


1405
01:44:12,425 --> 01:44:13,465
I know how it looks.


1406
01:44:13,465 --> 01:44:14,425
I check the food


1407
01:44:14,425 --> 01:44:15,785
it's dry and moldy


1408
01:44:15,785 --> 01:44:18,905
I check the the saddlebags, but God


1409
01:44:18,905 --> 01:44:19,945
you know all things.


1410
01:44:22,905 --> 01:44:24,185
That's a close ride.


1411
01:44:25,385 --> 01:44:28,505
If you're right now making uh crossroad


1412
01:44:28,505 --> 01:44:31,385
or if something's happening that's like strange


1413
01:44:31,385 --> 01:44:34,345
and you can't really know, is this God?


1414
01:44:34,345 --> 01:44:35,385
Is it not God?


1415
01:44:35,385 --> 01:44:38,505
What you can't go by


1416
01:44:38,505 --> 01:44:40,265
that you make money from it.


1417
01:44:41,785 --> 01:44:43,065
God's not into it


1418
01:44:43,065 --> 01:44:45,465
whatever makes more money, that's him.


1419
01:44:45,465 --> 01:44:46,825
God is not like that.


1420
01:44:48,265 --> 01:44:49,865
You gotta find out his will


1421
01:44:49,865 --> 01:44:52,905
you gotta discern spirits.


1422
01:44:52,905 --> 01:44:56,745
Not everyone who loses looks so sweet has a sweet spirit.


1423
01:44:56,745 --> 01:45:00,825
They're like those characters that the Radio City musical guy told me about.


1424
01:45:04,985 --> 01:45:09,065
If you want to just come to God today and sing with us


1425
01:45:09,065 --> 01:45:12,425
He is all I need because you have a dilemma.


1426
01:45:12,425 --> 01:45:13,625
You're at a crossroads.


1427
01:45:13,625 --> 01:45:14,905
Just get out of your seat right now.


1428
01:45:14,905 --> 01:45:19,705
Just slide out from where you are, slide out and come here to the front.


1429
01:45:21,945 --> 01:45:24,265
Just come out of your seat and say, Pastor


1430
01:45:24,265 --> 01:45:25,545
I want to pray.


1431
01:45:27,225 --> 01:45:28,985
Your sermon was for me.


1432
01:45:30,185 --> 01:45:35,785
Come from the balcony, come from downstairs, whatever, wherever, just get up here.


1433
01:45:38,825 --> 01:45:40,745
Let's sing from the beginning.


1434
01:45:40,745 --> 01:45:42,665
Everyone sing.


1435
01:45:42,665 --> 01:46:26,745
He is all saying everyone.


1436
01:47:10,345 --> 01:47:12,985
Every eye closed, just before we all stand


1437
01:47:14,105 --> 01:47:15,705
if this is meant for somebody


1438
01:47:15,705 --> 01:47:18,745
please take it as a word from the Lord.


1439
01:47:18,745 --> 01:47:22,585
Be careful who you rent that apartment to or those rooms to.


1440
01:47:24,025 --> 01:47:26,265
Pray about that because once they're in


1441
01:47:26,265 --> 01:47:28,585
it's almost impossible to get them out.


1442
01:47:30,025 --> 01:47:31,465
And you might mean well


1443
01:47:31,465 --> 01:47:33,945
and you want to help someone, but know


1444
01:47:33,945 --> 01:47:36,025
know that it's God's will.


1445
01:47:36,025 --> 01:47:37,865
Pray, he'll show you.


1446
01:47:37,865 --> 01:47:41,625
Let the person do everything that's right, but then pray.


1447
01:47:41,625 --> 01:47:44,185
God is this of you.


1448
01:47:44,185 --> 01:47:45,145
He will lead you


1449
01:47:45,145 --> 01:47:46,105
he will guide you


1450
01:47:46,105 --> 01:47:46,905
he'll protect you.


1451
01:47:48,585 --> 01:47:51,865
All the people said, Everyone stand now.


1452
01:47:51,865 --> 01:47:52,665
Sing loud.


1453
01:47:52,665 --> 01:47:53,145
Come on.


1454
01:47:54,265 --> 01:47:56,665
Come on, sing loud.


1455
01:47:56,665 --> 01:48:39,705
He is all like this


1456
01:48:39,705 --> 01:49:08,025
everyone is saying that.


1457
01:50:19,625 --> 01:50:23,865
We have absolute confidence that you are able to keep us.


1458
01:50:25,145 --> 01:50:30,665
But part of that is looking to you for your direction


1459
01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:37,065
and your discernment for our lives about all these things, people, situations.


1460
01:50:37,065 --> 01:50:38,265
Seems like an open door.


1461
01:50:38,265 --> 01:50:40,185
It looks like a good job opportunity


1462
01:50:40,185 --> 01:50:42,105
but is it you, Lord?


1463
01:50:42,105 --> 01:50:44,665
Or they're gibbeanights behind the door.


1464
01:50:46,505 --> 01:50:47,705
We can't know that.


1465
01:50:47,705 --> 01:50:52,105
We're we're not intelligent enough, wise enough.


1466
01:50:52,105 --> 01:50:53,865
But you know everything.


1467
01:50:53,865 --> 01:50:56,105
And you're our father.


1468
01:50:56,105 --> 01:50:57,785
God, you're my father.


1469
01:50:58,825 --> 01:51:00,185
You're our father.


1470
01:51:00,185 --> 01:51:02,265
We love you, Father.


1471
01:51:02,265 --> 01:51:04,425
Just tell the Father that you love him.


1472
01:51:04,425 --> 01:51:05,625
Just praise him out loud


1473
01:51:05,625 --> 01:51:06,825
right where you are.


1474
01:51:06,825 --> 01:51:07,785
Don't be embarrassed.


1475
01:51:07,785 --> 01:51:08,745
Tell him out loud.


1476
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:10,105
I love you, Father.


1477
01:51:10,105 --> 01:51:11,225
I love you, Father.


1478
01:51:11,225 --> 01:51:13,145
You're gonna protect me, Father.


1479
01:51:13,145 --> 01:51:15,625
You're gonna protect me, Father.


1480
01:51:18,345 --> 01:51:20,585
So, Lord, for the people in front of me


1481
01:51:20,585 --> 01:51:25,305
whatever they're facing, give them direction.


1482
01:51:25,305 --> 01:51:27,945
Give them confirmation when it's of you


1483
01:51:29,065 --> 01:51:31,625
and give them an alarm when it's not you.


1484
01:51:33,945 --> 01:51:35,785
Because we want to do your will.


1485
01:51:35,785 --> 01:51:37,785
We want to make you happy.


1486
01:51:37,785 --> 01:51:40,345
And making you happy, we bless ourselves.


1487
01:51:43,785 --> 01:51:46,585
So we commit today to you.


1488
01:51:46,585 --> 01:51:52,105
Speak to us in a anyway, through the word by the Holy Spirit in a dream


1489
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:56,665
and then uh confirm it so we know it's you, Lord, not our imagination.


1490
01:51:58,985 --> 01:52:00,585
You said test the spirits


1491
01:52:00,585 --> 01:52:01,945
teach us how to do that.


1492
01:52:03,145 --> 01:52:05,465
But not every spirit comes from God.


1493
01:52:06,745 --> 01:52:12,505
Protect us from fake preachers, fake apostles, fake miracles, fake everything.


1494
01:52:12,505 --> 01:52:13,785
We want the truth.


1495
01:52:13,785 --> 01:52:15,305
We want everything you have


1496
01:52:15,305 --> 01:52:17,145
but let it be true, Lord.


1497
01:52:17,145 --> 01:52:18,185
Let it be true.


1498
01:52:18,185 --> 01:52:22,585
New Testament, Holy Spirit moving in power.


1499
01:52:24,505 --> 01:52:26,105
We love you, Father


1500
01:52:26,105 --> 01:52:27,705
and we praise you, Father.


1501
01:52:32,105 --> 01:52:34,905
Bless the offering and the welcome center downstairs


1502
01:52:34,905 --> 01:52:38,425
but uh offering as people leave and give online.


1503
01:52:38,425 --> 01:52:42,825
Let my words, Lord, help somebody today.


1504
01:52:42,825 --> 01:52:45,865
You know, every time I've cried to you and said


1505
01:52:45,865 --> 01:52:48,665
give me something that will help the people.


1506
01:52:48,665 --> 01:52:50,505
You know that, God.


1507
01:52:50,505 --> 01:52:52,505
You know that.


1508
01:52:52,505 --> 01:52:56,905
I believe you gave me this word today to help the people.


1509
01:52:56,905 --> 01:52:58,505
Help us all through it.


1510
01:52:58,505 --> 01:52:59,865
Your word is truth.


1511
01:53:02,505 --> 01:53:05,305
We pray this in Jesus' name.


1512
01:53:05,305 --> 01:53:14,905
He is all in.
