You are with us, God.

We're conscious that you are with us today, Lord.

So we worship you like you're with us, God.

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,240
You're not far off, Lord.


197
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,319
You dwell within us, God.


198
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,559
And we give you praise, Jesus.

We pray your moving.


205
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,519
We pray your anointing, God.


206
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,119
We pray that you would touch your people again, Lord.


207
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,440
Bless, bless everything that happens.


208

because you're gracious.


212
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,000
You don't treat us, God


213
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,720
according to what we deserve, God.


214
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,599
Lord, you show us mercy and grace.

We bless you, Lord.

We praise you, and we give it this name in Jesus' name.

00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:36,160
But now I see the life I knew was hopeless until you rescue me.

and all the past we both go back to the way to before you stay


264
00:38:16,159 --> 00:39:48,239
and take the beat back to go back to the way to beat before the day news to before


265
00:39:48,239 --> 00:40:09,360
the presentation to the way you to be let's take me I won't go back


266
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:44,702
Let's say come on, everyone says


267
00:44:05,422 --> 00:44:10,142
flap your hands as hard as you can for the Lord.


268
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:14,062
We praise you, Jesus.


269
00:44:14,062 --> 00:44:16,062
We praise you, Jesus.


270
00:44:19,102 --> 00:44:23,342
We praise you with his blood.


271
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:07,582
So it was on a prayer meeting night eleven years ago


272
00:45:07,582 --> 00:45:12,222
when I had previously been out to California speaking in um


273
00:45:14,142 --> 00:45:17,022
where they have the Rose Bowl, Pasadena.


274
00:45:17,022 --> 00:45:19,582
I was in Pasadena, California


275
00:45:19,582 --> 00:45:24,782
for an event for the Southern District, Southern California District of the Assemblies of God


276
00:45:24,782 --> 00:45:26,222
and they were laying hands


277
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:37,502
and sending people out for home missions, like team challenges to Native American reservations and then foreign ports.


278
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:42,382
Way out there, there was a young lady named Amaren from Southern California.


279
00:45:42,382 --> 00:45:45,902
The Lord drew it her to my attention


280
00:45:45,902 --> 00:45:49,102
and uh she was gonna go learn Arabic


281
00:45:49,102 --> 00:45:55,262
and go and be placed in some undisc undisclosed spot in the Middle East


282
00:45:55,262 --> 00:45:58,062
to try to sh uh share Christ.


283
00:45:58,062 --> 00:45:59,822
And then there was this man


284
00:45:59,822 --> 00:46:01,902
and it ended up he was married


285
00:46:01,902 --> 00:46:04,702
and with three children named Adam Boyd.


286
00:46:05,822 --> 00:46:08,862
So I found out he was gonna go to Papua New Guinea


287
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:13,102
which is further away than London, then Korea.


288
00:46:13,102 --> 00:46:14,942
Papua New Guinea, wow


289
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:19,022
it's way out and then down in the southern Pacific.


290
00:46:19,022 --> 00:46:25,662
And um they were going to go out under the auspices of Whitecliffe Bible translators


291
00:46:25,662 --> 00:46:30,862
and they were going to a tribe, the major tribe in Papua New Guinea, um


292
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:35,422
who speak a language called Anga, E-N-G-A. Everyone say Enga.


293
00:46:35,422 --> 00:46:36,302
Anga.


294
00:46:36,302 --> 00:46:41,022
And the Anga people had no New Testament in their language.


295
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,542
So how could they study about Jesus?


296
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:46,302
How could they learn about Jesus?


297
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:49,102
How could they learn about the ministry of the Holy Spirit?


298
00:46:49,102 --> 00:46:53,662
How could they learn about what the Bible teaches about the second coming of Christ?


299
00:46:53,662 --> 00:46:56,542
How could they learn about how Christians should love each other?


300
00:46:56,542 --> 00:47:02,142
How could they learn anything uh with authority coming from the very word of God?


301
00:47:02,142 --> 00:47:02,862
Well, they couldn't


302
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:04,382
but they were Christians


303
00:47:04,382 --> 00:47:07,502
but it had been verbally transmitted the gospel.


304
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:13,822
So he was part of this team to put the Bible into the Enga language.


305
00:47:13,822 --> 00:47:17,502
And um So I want you to watch this, okay?


306
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,262
Let's go to dark and watch this.


307
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:43,102
What they call the Enga people are goal getters.


308
00:47:43,102 --> 00:47:46,462
They're influential in the capital city of Port Moresby


309
00:47:46,462 --> 00:47:48,942
where they work as business leaders


310
00:47:48,942 --> 00:47:50,782
uh leaders in the government


311
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:53,342
and they tend to be the movers and shakers.


312
00:47:53,342 --> 00:47:58,782
And so making sure that the Enga people have a translation of the New Testament is very important


313
00:47:58,782 --> 00:48:01,902
because they're influencing the rest of the country.


314
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,622
English is not our language


315
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:10,062
and pigeon is not our language, too.


316
00:48:10,062 --> 00:48:14,542
Hearing and reading the Bible in pigeon.


317
00:48:14,542 --> 00:48:20,542
The meaning of the word God is not very clear.


318
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:22,542
Somebody was preaching.


319
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:23,902
You know what he he did?


320
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:27,102
He read it into pigeon


321
00:48:27,102 --> 00:48:29,662
and then translated with his vocal.


322
00:48:29,662 --> 00:48:30,702
That I don't know.


323
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:31,902
It's not accurate.


324
00:48:31,902 --> 00:48:35,342
The missing lot of points or the adding lotter point.


325
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:36,862
That's not accurate.


326
00:48:36,862 --> 00:48:38,542
I want them to read it


327
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:42,222
and understand the whole message as it is.


328
00:48:42,222 --> 00:48:45,022
So that is why some of us came together


329
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:50,302
and found out that we should translate the Bible into anger.


330
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,782
It is not that you know one particular group


331
00:48:52,782 --> 00:48:55,582
or one particular church took initiative to translate this.


332
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:59,342
No, all we all the churches in anger, the church in denonation.


333
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:01,982
We come together and to translate this Bible


334
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:04,942
and now it's it's come into in our hands now.


335
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:10,622
I want to see the anger people taking Jesus at his word and living in peace.


336
00:49:10,622 --> 00:49:13,102
I wonder if people who love God


337
00:49:14,222 --> 00:49:17,982
and hear the story and then acknowledge and believe.


338
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:21,582
Christ died for all people.


339
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:23,742
When we are to work with all people


340
00:49:23,742 --> 00:49:28,462
the gospel of Christ might come to all people


341
00:49:28,462 --> 00:49:30,462
and understand the love of God.


342
00:49:34,142 --> 00:49:38,382
That's what I'm talking about, the Anga New Testament.


343
00:49:38,382 --> 00:49:43,822
So we laid hands on that couple.


344
00:49:43,822 --> 00:49:47,102
Their kids were much they were young then.


345
00:49:47,102 --> 00:49:49,582
And now, eleven years later, guess what?


346
00:49:49,582 --> 00:49:53,422
The Anga translation has been done.


347
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:57,022
All the people then who's there who speak Anga.


348
00:49:57,022 --> 00:50:01,822
And um uh I've been following the newsletters that Adam Boyd


349
00:50:01,822 --> 00:50:06,382
who is the um man of God and his wife Martha.


350
00:50:06,382 --> 00:50:07,582
And now their children


351
00:50:07,582 --> 00:50:12,222
imagine their children are now twenty, eighteen, and sixteen.


352
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:14,782
And they were just little of eleven years ago


353
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:16,382
they seemed so small.


354
00:50:16,382 --> 00:50:21,902
And here they were gonna leave everything in America to go to Papua New Guinea.


355
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:23,822
And I know at least for a while


356
00:50:23,822 --> 00:50:29,262
they were living out in uh nowhere's way out there.


357
00:50:29,262 --> 00:50:35,182
And uh grew up served God, still serving God


358
00:50:35,182 --> 00:50:39,582
and it just so happens we're blessed to have Adam Boyd visiting with us.


359
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:41,902
I want him to come up and say hello, everybody


360
00:50:41,902 --> 00:50:46,062
put your hands together from my friend Adam Boyd.


361
00:50:46,062 --> 00:50:46,782
Come on!


362
00:50:54,142 --> 00:50:56,542
Oh, good morning, church.


363
00:50:56,542 --> 00:50:58,142
It is such a joy


364
00:50:58,142 --> 00:51:00,142
and an honor to be with you.


365
00:51:00,142 --> 00:51:02,062
This church, this isn't our home church


366
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,582
but it feels like our home church.


367
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:08,862
Uh, I've never been around such a loving, prayerful group of Christians.


368
00:51:08,862 --> 00:51:12,542
And so it's just uh a blessing to be able to share this moment with you.


369
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:14,862
This is the Anga New Testament that we have.


370
00:51:19,662 --> 00:51:20,462
That's good.


371
00:51:20,462 --> 00:51:24,702
We've been able to complete the Anga New Testament uh in print format


372
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:27,662
as an audio, uh solar-powered audio player


373
00:51:27,662 --> 00:51:29,662
because most people don't know how to read very well.


374
00:51:29,662 --> 00:51:30,702
It's a Bible app


375
00:51:30,702 --> 00:51:32,382
you can get it on U version


376
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:35,342
and so people have access to it in a variety of ways.


377
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,062
But I'll tell you what


378
00:51:36,062 --> 00:51:37,662
it's not been easy.


379
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:42,622
There's been a lot of challenges, a lot of discouragement, a lot of obstacles


380
00:51:42,622 --> 00:51:48,862
and uh your prayers and your support have been so uh crucial to this process.


381
00:51:48,862 --> 00:51:50,302
And so I can't thank you enough.


382
00:51:50,302 --> 00:51:51,102
Coming here, you know


383
00:51:51,102 --> 00:51:52,782
there's times we want to give up and quit,


384
00:51:52,782 --> 00:51:55,342
and coming here is like a shot of adrenaline.


385
00:51:55,342 --> 00:51:58,862
And so thank you so much uh for that.


386
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:08,062
Um, when I look at all the obstacles and difficulties and discouragements, you know


387
00:52:08,062 --> 00:52:10,782
I said to my wife Martha about a year ago, I said, you know what


388
00:52:10,782 --> 00:52:13,662
it's really a miracle that this even exists.


389
00:52:13,662 --> 00:52:15,502
And so I give thanks to God.


390
00:52:15,502 --> 00:52:18,862
I thank Brooklyn Tabernacle from the bottom of my heart.


391
00:52:18,862 --> 00:52:20,142
Thank you so much.


392
00:52:20,142 --> 00:52:21,262
Thank you so much.


393
00:52:21,262 --> 00:52:24,382
And Pastor, I want to I want to give this thing in New Testament to you.


394
00:52:24,382 --> 00:52:25,102
For me?


395
00:52:25,102 --> 00:52:26,142
Yes.


396
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:29,182
This is uh a sign of your participation.


397
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:29,662
There you go.


398
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,662
I have no idea what this says.


399
00:52:33,662 --> 00:52:35,022
I I'll teach you how to read it.


400
00:52:35,022 --> 00:52:36,062
I thought that.


401
00:52:36,062 --> 00:52:37,022
Thank you so much.


402
00:52:37,022 --> 00:52:37,502
Thank you.


403
00:52:37,502 --> 00:52:38,222
Thank you, brother.


404
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:40,382
Let's hear one more time for Adam Boyd.


405
00:52:46,302 --> 00:52:52,862
You know, sometimes we greet each other uh in another language um this morning.


406
00:52:52,862 --> 00:52:54,622
Uh in the morning we say


407
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:56,942
do it in Spanish or whatever.


408
00:52:56,942 --> 00:52:58,462
Swahili.


409
00:52:58,462 --> 00:53:04,142
And I turned to uh some um people helping me who were they're from Jamaica, and I said


410
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:06,222
How do you say good morning in Jamaica?


411
00:53:07,422 --> 00:53:10,462
And they said, Manin, neighbor.


412
00:53:11,662 --> 00:53:12,542
Manin.


413
00:53:15,102 --> 00:53:18,222
Everybody turn and say, man, neighbor, to your friend.


414
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:33,662
So uh listen, we've been supporting no you, me


415
00:53:33,662 --> 00:53:36,862
we've been supporting this family for eleven years.


416
00:53:36,862 --> 00:53:38,542
Isn't that an honor?


417
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:39,102
I don't


418
00:53:39,102 --> 00:53:40,302
I don't think like, oh


419
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:42,862
should we support Adam Boyd and his family?


420
00:53:42,862 --> 00:53:45,742
That's like that we can be part of the reward.


421
00:53:46,862 --> 00:53:48,542
Imagine we went to get to heaven


422
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:50,382
and the rewards are passed out.


423
00:53:50,382 --> 00:53:51,742
There'll be rewards for him


424
00:53:51,742 --> 00:53:55,822
and his wife and those show to then they can go and do that


425
00:53:55,822 --> 00:53:57,022
but who will support them?


426
00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:58,622
Who will take care of them?


427
00:53:58,622 --> 00:54:00,222
So he's not the only one.


428
00:54:00,222 --> 00:54:02,942
We have people all over the world that we're supporting


429
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:05,742
which we never take a separate offering for.


430
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,102
So I'm saying to those watching online and all of you


431
00:54:09,102 --> 00:54:12,702
would you continue to please give even this morning?


432
00:54:12,702 --> 00:54:14,862
When you leave, there's baskets out there.


433
00:54:14,862 --> 00:54:16,702
You can put your offering in.


434
00:54:17,982 --> 00:54:23,262
And um when you um or you can give online.


435
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:27,102
I really get discouraged sometimes when I see the statistics.


436
00:54:28,142 --> 00:54:34,142
You know, um I I don't want to be legalistic about anything.


437
00:54:34,142 --> 00:54:35,582
But you you see statistics.


438
00:54:35,582 --> 00:54:37,502
When I was growing up, my mom


439
00:54:37,502 --> 00:54:40,302
even though my dad started drinking, lost a job


440
00:54:40,302 --> 00:54:44,382
my mother was taught and and took it upon herself.


441
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:47,582
Well, look, in the Old Testament before Christ came


442
00:54:47,582 --> 00:54:51,902
the people gave a tenth of their net pay.


443
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:55,422
So if you took home four hundred dollars, you gave forty.


444
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:57,902
Comprend that no compared.


445
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:00,942
So that was just a given, right?


446
00:55:00,942 --> 00:55:05,022
And now I see statistics of people who go to church


447
00:55:05,022 --> 00:55:07,662
and sing in choir and


448
00:55:07,662 --> 00:55:11,182
and deacons and just all over the whole thing.


449
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,462
Something, Adam,


450
00:55:12,462 --> 00:55:19,422
less than less than six percent of all the people who go to church and call themselves Christians,


451
00:55:19,422 --> 00:55:24,862
less than six percent give regularly ten percent of their income.


452
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:26,142
Let's say uh well


453
00:55:26,142 --> 00:55:27,742
I don't see that in the New Testament.


454
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:29,742
I don't want to argue with you.


455
00:55:29,742 --> 00:55:33,022
Um but if they were giving before Jesus died


456
00:55:33,022 --> 00:55:34,142
they gave ten percent.


457
00:55:34,142 --> 00:55:37,262
So what should we give less now to the work of the Lord?


458
00:55:37,262 --> 00:55:39,022
Does that make any sense to you?


459
00:55:39,022 --> 00:55:39,982
No, I'm asking you


460
00:55:39,982 --> 00:55:41,822
does that make any sense?


461
00:55:41,822 --> 00:55:43,262
So it's it's money


462
00:55:43,262 --> 00:55:45,662
the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.


463
00:55:45,662 --> 00:55:47,662
I was just reading through what was it


464
00:55:47,662 --> 00:55:49,822
Luke how Jesus died


465
00:55:49,822 --> 00:55:52,382
I mean the final coup de gras.


466
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:55,262
Was Judas betrayed him for filthy money.


467
00:55:56,782 --> 00:55:57,902
For filthy money.


468
00:55:59,262 --> 00:56:01,022
Not out of hate, but for money.


469
00:56:02,142 --> 00:56:05,502
He lost his soul for money, for silver.


470
00:56:05,502 --> 00:56:11,742
And when I see those statistics, um churches suffer, missionaries suffer


471
00:56:11,742 --> 00:56:18,622
churches could do so much more if the people, all of them, just gave systematically.


472
00:56:18,622 --> 00:56:21,182
Uh so I just want to challenge all of you


473
00:56:21,182 --> 00:56:25,342
and I never have checked once in my life here at this church


474
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:29,102
the pastors we're not privy to what people give.


475
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:30,542
That's that's not right.


476
00:56:30,542 --> 00:56:32,782
I'm not should be digging into what you give


477
00:56:32,782 --> 00:56:34,702
I should be just worried about what I give.


478
00:56:34,702 --> 00:56:36,062
Amen?


479
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:37,422
And then some churches


480
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:39,102
someone told me this again the other day


481
00:56:39,102 --> 00:56:40,382
they grew up in a church


482
00:56:40,382 --> 00:56:46,702
where the pastor would put on the bulletin board in the lobby what everybody gave the week before.


483
00:56:46,702 --> 00:56:48,702
I mean, really.


484
00:56:48,702 --> 00:56:50,222
I mean, really.


485
00:56:50,222 --> 00:56:52,942
That's like spiritual extortion, right?


486
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:56,142
You're gonna pressure people so that and shame them.


487
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:57,342
We don't want to do that


488
00:56:57,342 --> 00:57:01,102
because God doesn't love a come uh a compelled giver.


489
00:57:01,102 --> 00:57:03,182
He loves what kind of giver.


490
00:57:03,182 --> 00:57:06,622
So I I'm just you uh what when you don't give


491
00:57:06,622 --> 00:57:09,422
you lose out of the blessing, the peace of God.


492
00:57:09,422 --> 00:57:11,022
There's just special blessings.


493
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:14,862
Uh what does the Amplified Bible say say?


494
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:20,862
God loves bracket, cherishes above all other things


495
00:57:20,862 --> 00:57:22,302
will never do without


496
00:57:22,302 --> 00:57:25,262
will never abandon those who are cheerful givers.


497
00:57:26,382 --> 00:57:28,222
Because he's a giver, God's a giver.


498
00:57:29,342 --> 00:57:33,182
So um I just challenge all of you


499
00:57:33,182 --> 00:57:37,742
because American Christianity is whack in many ways.


500
00:57:37,742 --> 00:57:38,782
It's not biblical.


501
00:57:38,782 --> 00:57:41,662
You know, they're fighting to get the Angel language so


502
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:43,982
that people can learn what the Bible says.


503
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:45,822
And we have the Bible in English


504
00:57:45,822 --> 00:57:48,302
but we don't do what it says sometimes.


505
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:51,982
But listen, it's more blessed to give than to receive.


506
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:56,302
Isn't it something at Christmas time coming up soon, God willing?


507
00:57:56,302 --> 00:57:59,182
Isn't it something that around the world people curse God


508
00:57:59,182 --> 00:58:00,462
they don't know about anything


509
00:58:00,462 --> 00:58:01,662
yet they buy a gift


510
00:58:01,662 --> 00:58:03,262
and they give it to someone.


511
00:58:03,262 --> 00:58:09,262
And that's something that the birth of Christ reminds people about this thing of giving.


512
00:58:09,262 --> 00:58:11,342
For God so loved the world that he gave.


513
00:58:13,182 --> 00:58:15,182
Lord, I take a moment here to pray


514
00:58:15,182 --> 00:58:20,222
that you would bless us and the offering today, but an online giving.


515
00:58:20,222 --> 00:58:24,782
But God, would you help all of us to be faithful stewards?


516
00:58:24,782 --> 00:58:26,382
What what do we have


517
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:27,662
that you didn't give us?


518
00:58:28,862 --> 00:58:30,542
There's nothing I have, God


519
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:31,582
that you didn't give us.


520
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:34,622
And now I'm gonna withhold an offering to you.


521
00:58:35,822 --> 00:58:37,102
God forbid.


522
00:58:37,102 --> 00:58:39,502
So help me and Carol to be better givers.


523
00:58:39,502 --> 00:58:43,422
And all of us here in the room and watching online


524
00:58:43,422 --> 00:58:50,862
help us to remember that you are Jehovah Jira Jaira, our provider.


525
00:58:50,862 --> 00:58:52,142
And help us to share back.


526
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:53,422
Bless this offering.


527
00:58:53,422 --> 00:58:57,582
Let it go not only more money for the translation Anga


528
00:58:57,582 --> 00:58:59,182
but let it go around the world.


529
00:58:59,182 --> 00:59:01,262
Help us pay all our bills here.


530
00:59:01,262 --> 00:59:04,302
We ask all this in Jesus' name.


531
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:04,942
Amen.


532
00:59:06,062 --> 00:59:07,662
I don't speak much about giving


533
00:59:07,662 --> 00:59:10,222
and I don't do sermons about giving and all of that


534
00:59:10,222 --> 00:59:13,182
but I did just want to exhort you about that.


535
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:17,902
So today is Good News Sunday.


536
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:24,782
And we're gonna just share the good news about Jesus Christ, the gospel.


537
00:59:24,782 --> 00:59:26,622
A reminder for all of us.


538
00:59:26,622 --> 00:59:30,142
And maybe you're here today and you're a churchgoer


539
00:59:30,142 --> 00:59:31,662
but you're not a Christian.


540
00:59:33,662 --> 00:59:35,182
Wow, how did that happen?


541
00:59:36,542 --> 00:59:41,502
You know, one of the most mysterious verses in the New Testament is this Jesus said


542
00:59:41,502 --> 00:59:45,982
Many will say in that day, Lord, Lord


543
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:49,422
did we not cast out devils in your name


544
00:59:49,422 --> 00:59:53,022
and prophesy and heal in your name?


545
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:56,622
Obviously, knowing the name and knowing the power that's in that name,


546
00:59:56,622 --> 00:59:58,862
and believing in the supernatural.


547
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:00,222
And then Jesus said


548
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:04,462
and then at the end I will say, Depart from me.


549
01:00:04,462 --> 01:00:06,142
I never knew you.


550
01:00:06,142 --> 01:00:09,342
You didn't walk the way I asked you to walk.


551
01:00:09,342 --> 01:00:12,117
You didn't honor me with your life.


552
01:00:12,117 --> 01:00:13,717
So today is good news.


553
01:00:13,717 --> 01:00:15,557
We want to talk about the good news.


554
01:00:15,557 --> 01:00:20,037
How many are happy Jesus is about good news and not bad news?


555
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:21,717
There's enough bad news.


556
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:23,477
Oh, is there bad news?


557
01:00:23,477 --> 01:00:25,797
Is there bad news out there?


558
01:00:25,797 --> 01:00:32,197
So I want to give you a living example of the good news of Jesus Christ.


559
01:00:32,197 --> 01:00:34,117
I have never heard her testimony.


560
01:00:34,117 --> 01:00:36,037
I've heard about it.


561
01:00:36,037 --> 01:00:38,917
And walk through some of it with her.


562
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:40,677
She's employed by the church.


563
01:00:40,677 --> 01:00:43,477
Her name is Shireen Bridgewater.


564
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:48,917
Would you would you put your hands together in the room with Shereen Bridgewater?


565
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,957
Good morning, church family.


566
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:04,997
How are we today?


567
01:01:04,997 --> 01:01:08,197
I'm up here just to share a portion of my testimony


568
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:11,077
and what God has done in my life.


569
01:01:11,077 --> 01:01:13,317
I was raised with my mom


570
01:01:13,317 --> 01:01:15,477
and my dad in the beginning.


571
01:01:15,477 --> 01:01:17,237
I'm the oldest of four.


572
01:01:17,237 --> 01:01:19,637
How many know that when you're the eldest


573
01:01:19,637 --> 01:01:21,557
there's a lot on you?


574
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:23,797
I'm the eldest of four.


575
01:01:23,797 --> 01:01:29,077
Um so my dad struggled with drinking a lot.


576
01:01:29,077 --> 01:01:32,997
So you could just imagine how my home was, right?


577
01:01:32,997 --> 01:01:36,037
So at a very early age


578
01:01:36,037 --> 01:01:38,437
my mom became a single parent.


579
01:01:38,437 --> 01:01:39,717
I remember at seven


580
01:01:40,757 --> 01:01:45,317
my dad came home in a rage and he was drinking.


581
01:01:45,317 --> 01:01:49,397
And he came home and he started to argue with my mom.


582
01:01:50,597 --> 01:01:53,477
My siblings and myself were in the kitchen


583
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:54,997
and we didn't know what was going on


584
01:01:54,997 --> 01:01:58,197
but then he started physically abusing her.


585
01:01:58,197 --> 01:02:00,757
And so he beat her so bad


586
01:02:00,757 --> 01:02:02,917
that she had to go into the hospital.


587
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:04,197
And me and my siblings


588
01:02:04,197 --> 01:02:07,557
we watched this and we couldn't help her because we were so young.


589
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,517
And we were afraid that if we tried to help


590
01:02:10,517 --> 01:02:13,397
that he would probably do something to us.


591
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,957
So we wind up going to live with my nana.


592
01:02:17,397 --> 01:02:18,837
We went to live with my nana


593
01:02:18,837 --> 01:02:22,037
because my mom was in the hospital recovering.


594
01:02:22,037 --> 01:02:23,797
My dad fled.


595
01:02:23,797 --> 01:02:26,517
And so we never saw him again.


596
01:02:26,517 --> 01:02:28,837
And so while living with my nana, though


597
01:02:28,837 --> 01:02:31,077
my nana was a devout Christian.


598
01:02:31,077 --> 01:02:33,077
And I found that my uncles


599
01:02:33,077 --> 01:02:35,477
also my mom's siblings, they were Christians.


600
01:02:35,477 --> 01:02:37,877
My mom was just vaccinated at the time.


601
01:02:37,877 --> 01:02:39,877
And so my nana would always say


602
01:02:39,877 --> 01:02:41,237
You gotta go to church.


603
01:02:41,237 --> 01:02:42,277
You gotta go to church.


604
01:02:42,277 --> 01:02:44,437
So now that we're living with her


605
01:02:44,437 --> 01:02:46,357
we're in church.


606
01:02:46,357 --> 01:02:49,877
And we go into church


607
01:02:49,877 --> 01:02:53,317
and then I remember when I was about 16


608
01:02:53,317 --> 01:02:55,957
I accepted the Lord as my Savior


609
01:02:55,957 --> 01:02:58,357
and got baptized in that church.


610
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,757
And as I continue to go to the church, though


611
01:03:00,757 --> 01:03:04,757
I realized what I didn't know then that I know now


612
01:03:04,757 --> 01:03:07,717
that it was a lot of legalism going on in that church.


613
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,997
I couldn't wear pants on at the church


614
01:03:10,997 --> 01:03:12,517
I couldn't wear jewelry


615
01:03:12,517 --> 01:03:14,277
I couldn't wear makeup.


616
01:03:14,277 --> 01:03:15,717
There were so many things


617
01:03:15,717 --> 01:03:16,517
and I was like


618
01:03:16,517 --> 01:03:18,597
I can't get my ears pierced?


619
01:03:18,597 --> 01:03:19,957
I can't wear lip gloss?


620
01:03:19,957 --> 01:03:21,157
I couldn't understand it.


621
01:03:21,157 --> 01:03:24,117
But I was young and I was very naive.


622
01:03:24,117 --> 01:03:27,237
My mom was very strict after my dad left


623
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:29,877
and so she would we couldn't do a lot of things.


624
01:03:29,877 --> 01:03:31,477
How many grew up in the era


625
01:03:31,477 --> 01:03:33,557
where it was because I said so


626
01:03:33,557 --> 01:03:35,877
or because I told you so, right?


627
01:03:35,877 --> 01:03:38,277
So anytime we wanted to do anything


628
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:39,637
and why can't we do it?


629
01:03:39,637 --> 01:03:41,077
Because I said so.


630
01:03:41,077 --> 01:03:43,477
And so we just left it that way.


631
01:03:43,477 --> 01:03:50,277
And so now I got so tired of trying to be good in this church


632
01:03:50,277 --> 01:03:52,837
that I was in that I left.


633
01:03:52,837 --> 01:03:58,277
So I left, and maybe about 17, 18


634
01:03:58,277 --> 01:04:00,597
there was a guy that moved next door to me.


635
01:04:00,597 --> 01:04:02,437
We lived in a house and he lived next door


636
01:04:02,437 --> 01:04:04,757
and so we got to befriend one another.


637
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,197
We started dating.


638
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:10,837
Um, dated him until I was probably 21, got married, had a daughter


639
01:04:10,837 --> 01:04:13,557
and this was around 1980


640
01:04:13,557 --> 01:04:16,117
when Crack reared this ugly head.


641
01:04:16,117 --> 01:04:19,797
Okay, and everybody was doing everything to get this crack.


642
01:04:19,797 --> 01:04:22,757
And he decided that he wanted to go out with his friends


643
01:04:22,757 --> 01:04:24,597
and he got hooked on the crack.


644
01:04:24,597 --> 01:04:26,837
And so that marriage was over.


645
01:04:28,037 --> 01:04:30,677
My oldest daughter is special need


646
01:04:30,677 --> 01:04:33,237
so I had a lot on me at that time.


647
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:34,357
So, really and truly


648
01:04:34,357 --> 01:04:36,357
I didn't mind that he left.


649
01:04:36,357 --> 01:04:39,477
Um, and so after that, I just started, you know


650
01:04:39,477 --> 01:04:41,237
just living my life.


651
01:04:42,517 --> 01:04:48,837
I just started living my life and not reading the word, not going to church


652
01:04:48,837 --> 01:04:51,077
living in a backslidden state


653
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:52,837
just doing what I do.


654
01:04:52,837 --> 01:04:54,437
Um, had another child


655
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:56,357
and then after this


656
01:04:57,557 --> 01:05:00,517
um just just doing what I do.


657
01:05:00,517 --> 01:05:02,757
I met another guy.


658
01:05:02,757 --> 01:05:04,597
Now, at the at this time


659
01:05:04,597 --> 01:05:08,517
all of these things I was dealing with abandonment for what my dad did


660
01:05:08,517 --> 01:05:10,277
unforgiveness for what my dad did.


661
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:12,197
I had a lot of insecurities.


662
01:05:12,197 --> 01:05:14,757
There wasn't any words of affirmation going in my house.


663
01:05:14,757 --> 01:05:16,197
It was never, you can do it.


664
01:05:16,197 --> 01:05:17,717
I'm proud of you, I love you.


665
01:05:17,717 --> 01:05:19,157
None of that went on in my house.


666
01:05:19,157 --> 01:05:21,477
So I was really looking for love.


667
01:05:21,477 --> 01:05:24,757
Okay, and so I met this guy


668
01:05:24,757 --> 01:05:30,437
and he said to me everything that I thought I needed to hear.


669
01:05:30,437 --> 01:05:33,877
Everything that I thought I wanted.


670
01:05:33,877 --> 01:05:36,837
And so we started dating


671
01:05:36,837 --> 01:05:39,077
and he moved in with me after this.


672
01:05:39,077 --> 01:05:40,757
After some time, he moved in with me


673
01:05:40,757 --> 01:05:42,357
and everything was going good.


674
01:05:42,357 --> 01:05:43,797
Everything was going good.


675
01:05:43,797 --> 01:05:45,157
Took care of me


676
01:05:45,157 --> 01:05:47,637
took care of my children at the time, had two


677
01:05:47,637 --> 01:05:48,757
took care of them.


678
01:05:48,757 --> 01:05:50,357
I didn't want for anything.


679
01:05:52,277 --> 01:05:54,917
Everything was fine until it wasn't fine.


680
01:05:56,277 --> 01:06:00,757
So I'm in my apartment, bathing my kids


681
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:03,717
and I'm hearing a knock at the door.


682
01:06:03,717 --> 01:06:05,157
And I'm saying, okay


683
01:06:05,157 --> 01:06:06,517
somebody's knocking at the door.


684
01:06:06,517 --> 01:06:08,277
My boyfriend's in the back room.


685
01:06:08,277 --> 01:06:09,717
I go to the door.


686
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:11,397
There's a postal man there.


687
01:06:11,397 --> 01:06:13,157
He says, Hey, you share me?


688
01:06:13,157 --> 01:06:13,557
You


689
01:06:13,557 --> 01:06:15,797
Yeah, I got a package for you.


690
01:06:15,797 --> 01:06:17,397
I take the package.


691
01:06:17,397 --> 01:06:19,637
I put the package on the coffee table.


692
01:06:19,637 --> 01:06:21,557
I say, Hey, you got a package.


693
01:06:21,557 --> 01:06:22,917
I yell to the back.


694
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:24,197
I knew it wasn't for me


695
01:06:24,197 --> 01:06:25,877
because I didn't order anything.


696
01:06:25,877 --> 01:06:29,557
So I went to bathe my kids again.


697
01:06:29,557 --> 01:06:31,637
Now, after I'm bathing my kids


698
01:06:31,637 --> 01:06:32,517
maybe a minute later


699
01:06:32,517 --> 01:06:35,877
I'm hearing a forceful, like a real bang in the door


700
01:06:35,877 --> 01:06:38,197
like somebody wants to break in.


701
01:06:38,197 --> 01:06:39,877
I go to the door


702
01:06:39,877 --> 01:06:41,797
I open the door


703
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,637
and it was about five


704
01:06:43,637 --> 01:06:49,317
or six DEA agents with guns in my face saying


705
01:06:49,317 --> 01:06:50,917
Where did you put that package?


706
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:51,557
And I'm like


707
01:06:51,557 --> 01:06:52,517
Where did I put the package?


708
01:06:52,517 --> 01:06:53,797
I put it on the corby table.


709
01:06:53,797 --> 01:06:55,717
I look, the package is gone.


710
01:06:55,717 --> 01:06:57,237
He already took the package.


711
01:06:57,237 --> 01:07:00,837
Apparently, he probably was waiting for the package unbeknownst to me.


712
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:02,917
So I'm here with my hands up


713
01:07:02,917 --> 01:07:04,357
they're all in my face.


714
01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:06,517
They say, Who's in the apartment with you?


715
01:07:06,517 --> 01:07:08,837
I say, My boyfriend's in the apartment.


716
01:07:08,837 --> 01:07:10,597
He comes out, they say


717
01:07:10,597 --> 01:07:12,117
You got any more drugs in here?


718
01:07:12,117 --> 01:07:14,117
I go, We got drugs in here?


719
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,157
I was so like


720
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:16,837
we got drugs in here?


721
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:21,717
He had a little duffel bag that I would just put his clothes in


722
01:07:21,717 --> 01:07:24,517
I'd wash it and put his clothes in there.


723
01:07:24,517 --> 01:07:27,957
Apparently, because I took that package


724
01:07:27,957 --> 01:07:33,317
I found out that he there were many more packages that came that I didn't know about


725
01:07:33,317 --> 01:07:35,877
and they were allowing these packages to come so


726
01:07:35,877 --> 01:07:37,557
that they can build this case.


727
01:07:37,557 --> 01:07:39,717
And so when I took the package


728
01:07:39,717 --> 01:07:41,557
I'm saying to them


729
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,157
what was in the package?


730
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:46,197
Oh, you don't know what was in the package?


731
01:07:46,197 --> 01:07:47,397
I said, No, I don't.


732
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,677
My hands are still up


733
01:07:48,677 --> 01:07:51,237
the guns are still in my face.


734
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:56,997
They said a key kilo of cocaine was in the package.


735
01:07:56,997 --> 01:07:58,277
I said, What?


736
01:07:59,317 --> 01:08:00,437
Okay.


737
01:08:00,437 --> 01:08:05,317
Now I'm devastated, I'm upset, I'm angry


738
01:08:05,317 --> 01:08:06,677
because how did you put me


739
01:08:06,677 --> 01:08:09,557
and my children in harm's way like this?


740
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:11,477
So I still got my hands up.


741
01:08:11,477 --> 01:08:12,437
We both got our hands up.


742
01:08:12,437 --> 01:08:14,357
They go, You got any more drugs in here?


743
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:16,997
I'm looking at him because I'm like, you better not.


744
01:08:16,997 --> 01:08:21,717
So they looked in his bag, all the way down in the bottom of his bag.


745
01:08:21,717 --> 01:08:28,757
There was another key of another kilo of cocaine and $65,000.


746
01:08:28,757 --> 01:08:31,797
So you can only imagine what I'm feeling now, okay?


747
01:08:31,797 --> 01:08:33,557
Because it's my apartment.


748
01:08:33,557 --> 01:08:35,317
The package came in my name


749
01:08:35,317 --> 01:08:36,917
and everything that they found


750
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:38,917
it was in my apartment.


751
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:41,397
So I'm like, wait a minute now.


752
01:08:41,397 --> 01:08:43,957
All of this was going on right under my nose


753
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:44,997
and I didn't even know.


754
01:08:44,997 --> 01:08:47,237
This is how naive I was.


755
01:08:47,237 --> 01:08:50,597
And so you can only guess what happened.


756
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:51,717
And by the way


757
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:54,757
that little postal man that I took the package from, oh


758
01:08:54,757 --> 01:08:56,357
he was a DEA agent.


759
01:08:56,357 --> 01:08:58,037
He was disguised.


760
01:08:58,037 --> 01:09:01,077
And so we're off to jail.


761
01:09:02,277 --> 01:09:05,397
So I'm in the federal prison.


762
01:09:05,397 --> 01:09:08,357
And I had to get someone to watch my kids


763
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,877
had to get my neighbor to watch my kids and let them know


764
01:09:11,877 --> 01:09:13,077
tell my mom what happened


765
01:09:13,077 --> 01:09:14,437
when she came home from work.


766
01:09:14,437 --> 01:09:15,877
So now I'm in prison.


767
01:09:15,877 --> 01:09:16,597
I'm in jail.


768
01:09:16,597 --> 01:09:18,277
We're both in jail.


769
01:09:18,277 --> 01:09:21,157
I had two days before I went before the judge.


770
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,397
And when I go before the judge


771
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:24,677
she's looking at me


772
01:09:24,677 --> 01:09:26,997
she got cases before me


773
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,277
and then she goes


774
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:30,997
The prosecutor is telling the story.


775
01:09:30,997 --> 01:09:33,077
How he's telling the facts


776
01:09:33,077 --> 01:09:34,597
everything's in my name


777
01:09:34,597 --> 01:09:36,197
it was my apartment


778
01:09:36,197 --> 01:09:41,077
but he was making me sound like I was flinging drugs all my life.


779
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:43,717
I'm like, who was he talking about?


780
01:09:43,717 --> 01:09:44,037
Me.


781
01:09:45,877 --> 01:09:48,837
My lawyer starts to speak on my behalf


782
01:09:48,837 --> 01:09:51,637
and he did the best that he could with the facts


783
01:09:51,637 --> 01:09:54,677
but the fact still remained that everything laid on me.


784
01:09:54,677 --> 01:09:57,717
So the judge looked at me.


785
01:09:57,717 --> 01:10:01,237
She said, bail set at one million dollars.


786
01:10:02,677 --> 01:10:06,117
And you can only imagine how I was feeling.


787
01:10:06,117 --> 01:10:08,597
I would had so many many emotions.


788
01:10:08,597 --> 01:10:10,437
Who's gonna watch my kids?


789
01:10:10,437 --> 01:10:11,557
What is going on?


790
01:10:11,557 --> 01:10:14,597
I still was so confused because it happened so fast.


791
01:10:15,797 --> 01:10:18,517
I go back to my cell


792
01:10:18,517 --> 01:10:20,277
my lawyer comes to visit me.


793
01:10:20,277 --> 01:10:22,597
He said it's not looking good for you.


794
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:24,277
He said, Everything is against you


795
01:10:24,277 --> 01:10:25,557
everything is in your name


796
01:10:25,557 --> 01:10:26,917
it's not looking good.


797
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:30,517
He said, You're looking at 25 years to life without parole.


798
01:10:33,717 --> 01:10:35,477
It was a horrible day for me.


799
01:10:36,837 --> 01:10:38,677
It was a horrible day for me.


800
01:10:38,677 --> 01:10:47,797
I felt abandoned, shame, still dealing with unforgiveness, a lot of insecurities.


801
01:10:50,837 --> 01:10:52,837
I was dealing with a lot.


802
01:10:52,837 --> 01:10:57,157
And so, but I remember when I had to go back into my cell


803
01:10:57,157 --> 01:11:00,117
I remember the church that I went to.


804
01:11:00,117 --> 01:11:02,517
I remember my grandma telling me, you know


805
01:11:02,517 --> 01:11:04,757
about Jesus and what I learned about Jesus.


806
01:11:04,757 --> 01:11:07,077
And even though it was very legalistic


807
01:11:07,077 --> 01:11:08,917
I remember they said Jesus loves me


808
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:10,757
and he has a plan for my life.


809
01:11:10,757 --> 01:11:12,997
And I knew that this was not the plan.


810
01:11:12,997 --> 01:11:14,997
So when I went back into my cell


811
01:11:14,997 --> 01:11:18,677
I started to have a real conversation with the Lord.


812
01:11:18,677 --> 01:11:20,437
Didn't know how to pray


813
01:11:20,437 --> 01:11:23,637
didn't know if he even heard me or was listening to me.


814
01:11:23,637 --> 01:11:29,477
I just had an honest conversation with him from a heart of despair and confusion.


815
01:11:29,477 --> 01:11:32,197
I just spoke and it said, God


816
01:11:32,197 --> 01:11:34,357
look what I've done to my life.


817
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:35,877
I've messed up.


818
01:11:35,877 --> 01:11:38,037
I said, Well, what happened to my kids?


819
01:11:38,037 --> 01:11:40,277
I'm so sorry for what I've done.


820
01:11:40,277 --> 01:11:45,317
It I dug, I was in a pit so deep


821
01:11:45,317 --> 01:11:49,637
so deep that I didn't even know how I was gonna get out of that.


822
01:11:49,637 --> 01:11:52,757
I stayed in my cell for the whole week I had to wait.


823
01:11:52,757 --> 01:11:54,197
And I stayed in my cell.


824
01:11:54,197 --> 01:11:57,077
And I said, Lord, this is it.


825
01:11:57,077 --> 01:11:58,997
I go in front of the judge


826
01:11:58,997 --> 01:12:00,917
and she's just sending people to jail.


827
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:02,917
Ten years, five years.


828
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:06,997
I was so I stood in front of her


829
01:12:06,997 --> 01:12:09,717
and she said to me words that I'll never forget.


830
01:12:10,757 --> 01:12:11,957
She sit up in her


831
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:15,717
she sat up in her chair, she leaned over, and she said


832
01:12:15,717 --> 01:12:18,277
I don't know why I'm doing this


833
01:12:18,277 --> 01:12:21,397
but I'm letting you out on your own recognizance today.


834
01:12:22,597 --> 01:12:25,877
That was only the mercy of God.


835
01:12:25,877 --> 01:12:28,197
Only the mercy of God.


836
01:12:28,197 --> 01:12:30,357
I got out of prison that day


837
01:12:30,357 --> 01:12:34,117
and I had to go to every single court date.


838
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:36,597
If I didn't go to every single court date


839
01:12:36,597 --> 01:12:38,757
she was gonna take back that.


840
01:12:38,757 --> 01:12:41,157
Every single court date.


841
01:12:41,157 --> 01:12:44,037
Can I tell you how good God was to me?


842
01:12:45,317 --> 01:12:50,597
25 years to life without parole, cancelled.


843
01:12:50,597 --> 01:12:53,717
One million dollar bill, cancelled.


844
01:12:53,717 --> 01:12:56,197
I turned my life back to Jesus.


845
01:12:57,397 --> 01:13:02,117
He dealt with my um my my abandonment, my unforgiveness


846
01:13:02,117 --> 01:13:03,797
everything that I was dealing with.


847
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:05,557
He took it all away.


848
01:13:05,557 --> 01:13:07,957
I've been serving God ever since.


849
01:13:07,957 --> 01:13:09,157
And let me tell you


850
01:13:09,157 --> 01:13:11,877
God hated the crimes of his children.


851
01:13:11,877 --> 01:13:15,157
He never turned into the crimes of his children.


852
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:19,557
He's as close as the mention of his name.


853
01:13:19,557 --> 01:13:21,237
Trust him.


854
01:13:21,237 --> 01:13:24,197
We serve an awesome God.


855
01:13:24,197 --> 01:13:25,397
God bless you.


856
01:13:55,557 --> 01:13:56,837
Isn't that amazing?


857
01:13:59,077 --> 01:14:02,517
Did you know there I just want to give you this no sermon?


858
01:14:03,877 --> 01:14:05,957
There's a word in the New Testament


859
01:14:05,957 --> 01:14:10,117
which is used over and over again, very meaningful.


860
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:12,837
It's the word come, C-O-M-E.


861
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:18,117
As in a request, like, come here.


862
01:14:19,717 --> 01:14:24,597
And Jesus would use it like this.


863
01:14:26,437 --> 01:14:30,757
Come unto me, all ye that are labor laboring and are heavy laden


864
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:32,757
and I will give you rest.


865
01:14:32,757 --> 01:14:35,557
What do you have to do to get the rest?


866
01:14:35,557 --> 01:14:36,757
You gotta come.


867
01:14:38,037 --> 01:14:44,437
He used it another time, I'm thinking, um, is anyone thirsty?


868
01:14:44,437 --> 01:14:47,637
Let him come to me and drink.


869
01:14:47,637 --> 01:14:50,597
Rivers of living water will come out of his life.


870
01:14:50,597 --> 01:14:55,557
In other words, if you're living without peace, like she was, like I have


871
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:57,877
like you maybe have


872
01:14:57,877 --> 01:14:59,637
you gotta come to Jesus.


873
01:14:59,637 --> 01:15:02,997
But it has nothing to do with physical movement.


874
01:15:02,997 --> 01:15:08,757
It doesn't mean come from there to there, or even come from the street into a church.


875
01:15:08,757 --> 01:15:11,877
It's your heart moving to Jesus.


876
01:15:11,877 --> 01:15:15,877
Your heart saying, like she said, Lord, I messed up.


877
01:15:15,877 --> 01:15:17,957
This ain't right.


878
01:15:17,957 --> 01:15:19,397
You have to help me.


879
01:15:20,997 --> 01:15:27,717
And it's amazing that even though we have all good things waiting for us from Jesus


880
01:15:27,717 --> 01:15:29,717
if we'll just come


881
01:15:29,717 --> 01:15:36,597
God has given us this gift of free will so


882
01:15:36,597 --> 01:15:41,477
that many never come even though it's to their own destruction.


883
01:15:41,477 --> 01:15:43,637
Listen what I'm saying.


884
01:15:43,637 --> 01:15:48,117
God has created this world and us humans


885
01:15:48,117 --> 01:15:51,797
and he will not violate something called our free will.


886
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:55,397
We can say yes or we can say no.


887
01:15:55,397 --> 01:15:58,597
No, you can't stop God from doing what he wants to do.


888
01:15:58,597 --> 01:16:00,117
Yes, you can.


889
01:16:00,117 --> 01:16:01,237
By just saying, no


890
01:16:01,237 --> 01:16:03,157
I'm not coming.


891
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:05,237
At the end of his three


892
01:16:05,237 --> 01:16:11,477
and a half years of ministry as an adult, 30 to 3.5, let's say


893
01:16:11,477 --> 01:16:13,877
Jesus wept over Jerusalem.


894
01:16:13,877 --> 01:16:17,237
Listen to what he said about the city that he came to.


895
01:16:17,237 --> 01:16:18,837
Jerusalem, Jerusalem.


896
01:16:18,837 --> 01:16:22,757
I wonder how many people he's weeping over right now in this building.


897
01:16:23,957 --> 01:16:26,437
And it was a religious city.


898
01:16:26,437 --> 01:16:28,677
The most religious city you could imagine.


899
01:16:28,677 --> 01:16:31,477
And Jesus said, Jerusalem, Jerusalem


900
01:16:31,477 --> 01:16:33,797
how many times I would have gathered you


901
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:37,317
and hovered over you and took you in close to me


902
01:16:37,317 --> 01:16:39,957
and protected you and given you salvation.


903
01:16:39,957 --> 01:16:41,797
How many times I would have done that


904
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,637
but you wouldn't let me?


905
01:16:43,637 --> 01:16:45,157
You said no.


906
01:16:45,157 --> 01:16:48,517
And now you got a bad future ahead of you.


907
01:16:48,517 --> 01:16:51,397
It wasn't that he wasn't loving and kind


908
01:16:51,397 --> 01:16:54,117
it wasn't that he didn't invite them to come


909
01:16:54,117 --> 01:16:56,997
but the problem was they said no.


910
01:16:58,357 --> 01:16:59,397
They said no.


911
01:16:59,397 --> 01:17:01,397
You can just keep playing, Jeffrey.


912
01:17:01,397 --> 01:17:03,397
I don't want to talk for long here.


913
01:17:03,397 --> 01:17:06,677
She was the preacher this morning, wasn't she?


914
01:17:06,677 --> 01:17:09,077
She said she was nervous in my office.


915
01:17:09,077 --> 01:17:10,597
She didn't look nervous to me.


916
01:17:10,597 --> 01:17:12,037
She looked like a preacher to me.


917
01:17:12,037 --> 01:17:13,157
What do you think?


918
01:17:13,157 --> 01:17:14,997
Can we thank God for her?


919
01:17:18,517 --> 01:17:23,717
So he wept over that city.


920
01:17:23,717 --> 01:17:26,277
Now, if he could force them to come


921
01:17:26,277 --> 01:17:28,197
why would he weep over them?


922
01:17:28,197 --> 01:17:30,277
No, it's like you love someone


923
01:17:30,277 --> 01:17:32,597
and they jilt you.


924
01:17:32,597 --> 01:17:35,477
Have you ever loved someone and they went, get out of here?


925
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:37,957
That hurts.


926
01:17:37,957 --> 01:17:39,637
It's painful.


927
01:17:39,637 --> 01:17:41,797
And that's what people do to Jesus.


928
01:17:41,797 --> 01:17:44,917
That's how he ended up on a cross.


929
01:17:44,917 --> 01:17:49,077
Some said yes, and most said, no, no, no, no way.


930
01:17:49,077 --> 01:17:53,237
I'm not giving up the way I want to live, doing my thing.


931
01:17:53,237 --> 01:17:56,037
I'm not giving that up to follow where?


932
01:17:56,037 --> 01:17:58,517
Follow and live a different kind of life


933
01:17:58,517 --> 01:18:00,997
not knowing that when he says, Come


934
01:18:00,997 --> 01:18:01,797
if you'll come


935
01:18:01,797 --> 01:18:04,037
you'll have the best life you ever dreamed of.


936
01:18:04,037 --> 01:18:05,397
And when you die


937
01:18:05,397 --> 01:18:07,237
you'll be with him forever and ever.


938
01:18:07,237 --> 01:18:09,557
So imagine by saying no to Jesus


939
01:18:09,557 --> 01:18:11,957
imagine what we bring on ourselves.


940
01:18:13,477 --> 01:18:15,637
And he kept saying, just come.


941
01:18:15,637 --> 01:18:17,397
Not bring a lot of money


942
01:18:17,397 --> 01:18:18,677
not fix up your life.


943
01:18:18,677 --> 01:18:21,237
No, come exactly the way you are.


944
01:18:21,237 --> 01:18:23,317
Just come to me.


945
01:18:23,317 --> 01:18:25,157
I know, but let me get this fixed.


946
01:18:25,157 --> 01:18:27,077
No, no, you'll never get it fixed.


947
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:31,557
Just come with the mess and let him bless.


948
01:18:31,557 --> 01:18:33,397
And he'll change everything.


949
01:18:33,397 --> 01:18:34,517
But you gotta come


950
01:18:34,517 --> 01:18:36,197
just you gotta get there.


951
01:18:38,997 --> 01:18:47,717
So this free will which has made the possibility of evil in the world.


952
01:18:47,717 --> 01:18:50,677
How can a good God have a world with so much evil?


953
01:18:50,677 --> 01:18:54,597
That's because God won't violate our free will.


954
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:58,837
That's the way he's chosen in his sovereignty to run this world.


955
01:19:00,517 --> 01:19:04,197
But I ran into something, congregation, this week


956
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:09,877
that has me thinking about another kind of uh come, come back.


957
01:19:11,157 --> 01:19:14,757
So you remember um you remember


958
01:19:14,757 --> 01:19:23,157
when Peter and the disciples were with Jesus at the Last Supper, and Jesus said


959
01:19:23,157 --> 01:19:25,077
I'm gonna be betrayed tonight


960
01:19:25,077 --> 01:19:29,077
and they started arguing about who was gonna betray him


961
01:19:29,077 --> 01:19:34,037
and um it was a lot of confusion there at the table.


962
01:19:34,037 --> 01:19:37,317
And then Jesus said this to Peter


963
01:19:37,317 --> 01:19:40,517
in it's found in Luke Simon, Simon


964
01:19:40,517 --> 01:19:43,797
Satan has asked to sift all of you.


965
01:19:43,797 --> 01:19:47,077
I like the way the NIV puts in all of you


966
01:19:47,077 --> 01:19:50,357
because some of the other translations just has you


967
01:19:50,357 --> 01:19:52,837
but the you is in the plural.


968
01:19:52,837 --> 01:19:55,237
Like we could say, come, you know


969
01:19:55,237 --> 01:19:56,757
could could you come


970
01:19:56,757 --> 01:19:57,877
meaning a whole family


971
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,157
could you come to my house?


972
01:19:59,157 --> 01:20:02,277
Or individual, come you, you, you and you.


973
01:20:02,277 --> 01:20:04,357
I don't know how it is in the Anga language


974
01:20:04,357 --> 01:20:05,557
but it could mean plural


975
01:20:05,557 --> 01:20:08,037
it could mean uh one person.


976
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:12,485
So the translation added all of you.


977
01:20:12,485 --> 01:20:15,685
Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat.


978
01:20:15,685 --> 01:20:17,525
It's a time of testing coming.


979
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:21,365
But I have prayed for you, Simon


980
01:20:21,365 --> 01:20:23,685
that your faith may not fail.


981
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:29,045
And when you have turned back, strengthened your brothers.


982
01:20:29,045 --> 01:20:33,525
And that word turn back in the in the Bible we're most familiar with


983
01:20:33,525 --> 01:20:35,525
a lot of us King James, it says


984
01:20:35,525 --> 01:20:39,765
and when you are converted, strengthen your brothers.


985
01:20:39,765 --> 01:20:41,605
Well, how could Peter be converted


986
01:20:41,605 --> 01:20:43,925
when he had been with Jesus three and a half years?


987
01:20:43,925 --> 01:20:45,685
So there's a double meaning.


988
01:20:45,685 --> 01:20:47,525
Some of you have never come.


989
01:20:47,525 --> 01:20:49,045
You've never come to the Lord.


990
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:51,205
You've never let him totally change your life.


991
01:20:51,205 --> 01:20:53,685
You could be in a family of a minister.


992
01:20:53,685 --> 01:20:56,965
You could be a deacon in a in some church watching


993
01:20:56,965 --> 01:21:02,005
but you've never had that come to Jesus moment of new birth


994
01:21:02,005 --> 01:21:04,085
and a change in your life.


995
01:21:04,085 --> 01:21:06,245
And she made me think of that.


996
01:21:09,205 --> 01:21:12,565
Because you know, she grew up with some experience of the Lord.


997
01:21:12,565 --> 01:21:15,045
So the Lord says to Peter, now Peter


998
01:21:15,045 --> 01:21:16,805
I know you're full of yourself right now


999
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:19,125
and you think this and that.


1000
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:21,125
But listen, when you mess up


1001
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,325
because I know you're gonna mess up


1002
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:26,805
uh when you can get converted


1003
01:21:26,805 --> 01:21:30,085
when when you rethink everything


1004
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:31,765
when you come back to me


1005
01:21:33,445 --> 01:21:37,525
strengthen your brothers and sisters because they go through things.


1006
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:38,565
Haven't any of us


1007
01:21:38,565 --> 01:21:40,565
since we started our Christian life


1008
01:21:40,565 --> 01:21:42,725
haven't some of us gone down a wrong trail?


1009
01:21:44,645 --> 01:21:48,805
Is it isn't it true that some of us are not like it once was with the Lord?


1010
01:21:48,805 --> 01:21:50,965
We need to get converted.


1011
01:21:50,965 --> 01:21:53,445
Not like converted, like we don't know the Lord


1012
01:21:53,445 --> 01:21:54,805
but converted like this.


1013
01:21:54,805 --> 01:21:56,085
Come back.


1014
01:21:56,085 --> 01:22:00,405
So the Lord not only says, Come unto me, all you that labor and heavy laden


1015
01:22:00,405 --> 01:22:01,525
I'll give you rest.


1016
01:22:01,525 --> 01:22:04,565
Anyone thirsty, let him come and drink of the waters, right?


1017
01:22:04,565 --> 01:22:06,965
He not only says that, he says, Come on


1018
01:22:06,965 --> 01:22:09,125
once you come back up there in the balcony


1019
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:11,125
once you come back.


1020
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:13,445
It's not like it used to be, come back.


1021
01:22:13,445 --> 01:22:15,045
He's got stuff for you to do.


1022
01:22:15,045 --> 01:22:16,885
He has people he wants you to bless


1023
01:22:16,885 --> 01:22:19,685
but how can you bless them unless you come back?


1024
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,205
In other words, come back.


1025
01:22:22,245 --> 01:22:23,045
Come back.


1026
01:22:23,045 --> 01:22:24,725
Not just come the first time


1027
01:22:24,725 --> 01:22:25,925
but after you drift


1028
01:22:25,925 --> 01:22:27,685
remember he's always saying, Come back.


1029
01:22:27,685 --> 01:22:30,805
And the amazing thing about the Lord I've learned from my own life


1030
01:22:30,805 --> 01:22:32,005
and you see it in the Bible


1031
01:22:32,005 --> 01:22:34,485
is no matter how many times you stray


1032
01:22:34,485 --> 01:22:36,085
he's still saying, Come back.


1033
01:22:36,085 --> 01:22:37,445
He never says, Oh


1034
01:22:37,445 --> 01:22:38,565
it's gonna be like that?


1035
01:22:38,565 --> 01:22:39,605
You're gonna be like that?


1036
01:22:39,605 --> 01:22:40,565
Then get out of here


1037
01:22:40,565 --> 01:22:42,325
I never want to see you again.


1038
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:44,165
He never does that.


1039
01:22:44,165 --> 01:22:46,085
He's always saying, Come back.


1040
01:22:46,085 --> 01:22:48,165
Do I get an amen?


1041
01:22:48,165 --> 01:22:50,805
He's always saying, Come back.


1042
01:22:50,805 --> 01:22:55,365
Because drifting is a very, very dangerous thing.


1043
01:22:55,365 --> 01:22:56,725
You drift, you drift


1044
01:22:56,725 --> 01:22:58,165
and the next thing you know


1045
01:22:58,165 --> 01:23:00,885
you don't sense his voice anymore.


1046
01:23:00,885 --> 01:23:02,485
Your conscience gets hard.


1047
01:23:02,485 --> 01:23:05,605
Now you're doing things you never dreamed.


1048
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:06,405
Right?


1049
01:23:06,405 --> 01:23:10,565
When uh when Shireen was growing up


1050
01:23:10,565 --> 01:23:12,085
you think she'd say, Yeah


1051
01:23:12,085 --> 01:23:15,525
one day I'll live with this guy, not my husband, a drug addict


1052
01:23:15,525 --> 01:23:17,605
I'll have my kids there, and no


1053
01:23:17,605 --> 01:23:19,285
she never thought that's what happened.


1054
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:21,285
Everything is gradual.


1055
01:23:21,285 --> 01:23:23,525
When you grow in the Lord, it's gradual.


1056
01:23:23,525 --> 01:23:25,685
You don't grow overnight, you grow gradually.


1057
01:23:25,685 --> 01:23:27,125
Same thing about drifting.


1058
01:23:28,165 --> 01:23:30,485
You drift gradually.


1059
01:23:30,485 --> 01:23:31,685
And the next thing you know


1060
01:23:31,685 --> 01:23:35,685
you find yourself so far out, so far gone.


1061
01:23:35,685 --> 01:23:36,885
Maybe some of you


1062
01:23:36,885 --> 01:23:38,005
if you just think back


1063
01:23:38,005 --> 01:23:40,645
how was it ten years ago, five years ago?


1064
01:23:40,645 --> 01:23:42,165
Or way back when you were a kid


1065
01:23:42,165 --> 01:23:45,045
and tender and your heart was virgin


1066
01:23:45,045 --> 01:23:49,845
and now the Lord is saying to us, Come, come back.


1067
01:23:49,845 --> 01:23:51,285
No, I'm afraid of you.


1068
01:23:51,285 --> 01:23:54,085
No, I love you, come back.


1069
01:23:54,085 --> 01:23:55,845
You the answer is not there


1070
01:23:55,845 --> 01:23:56,805
the answer is here.


1071
01:23:56,805 --> 01:23:59,285
Come to me, come back.


1072
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:03,845
So the very last thought in the Bible goes something like this in Revelation.


1073
01:24:03,845 --> 01:24:05,445
Just look.


1074
01:24:05,445 --> 01:24:09,365
The Spirit and the bride say, Come.


1075
01:24:09,365 --> 01:24:12,085
And let the one who hears say, Come.


1076
01:24:13,205 --> 01:24:16,005
Let the one who is thirsty come


1077
01:24:16,005 --> 01:24:18,245
and let the one who wishes


1078
01:24:18,245 --> 01:24:22,725
the one who wishes take from the free gift of the water of life.


1079
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:28,405
So the last thought in the Bible is a double thought of this word come.


1080
01:24:28,405 --> 01:24:30,645
It's the coming of the Lord.


1081
01:24:30,645 --> 01:24:34,965
The Spirit, Holy Spirit, and the bride, the church, says to the Lord,


1082
01:24:34,965 --> 01:24:37,605
Come, even so, come quickly, Lord Jesus.


1083
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,045
Come in here looking forward to


1084
01:24:39,045 --> 01:24:40,565
when the Lord comes back


1085
01:24:40,565 --> 01:24:42,325
and we get out of here.


1086
01:24:42,325 --> 01:24:43,925
Maybe you're happy here.


1087
01:24:43,925 --> 01:24:46,485
Mazeltov, I am not happy here.


1088
01:24:46,485 --> 01:24:48,485
I want to do what God wants me to do


1089
01:24:48,485 --> 01:24:52,325
but I would like to get out of here today if it was possible.


1090
01:24:52,325 --> 01:24:56,005
Do I get a hand clap of praise from anybody else?


1091
01:25:00,805 --> 01:25:05,285
So the Spirit, Holy Spirit, and the bride, the church, says, come.


1092
01:25:05,285 --> 01:25:07,765
And then John turns it around.


1093
01:25:07,765 --> 01:25:11,205
And anyone, anyone who's thirsty


1094
01:25:11,205 --> 01:25:12,725
the one who's thirsty, come.


1095
01:25:12,725 --> 01:25:14,085
Let the one who wishes.


1096
01:25:14,085 --> 01:25:16,405
Come on, just come to Jesus.


1097
01:25:16,405 --> 01:25:18,085
They mocked that today.


1098
01:25:18,085 --> 01:25:19,365
They I don't like that.


1099
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:21,525
You hear it uh in politics


1100
01:25:21,525 --> 01:25:23,445
you hear in sports, even like, oh


1101
01:25:23,445 --> 01:25:25,285
he had a come to Jesus moment.


1102
01:25:25,285 --> 01:25:28,325
That means like there was a dramatic moment in his life.


1103
01:25:28,325 --> 01:25:31,125
But that that profanes something sacred.


1104
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:35,685
The most beautiful thing that can happen in your life today is to come to Jesus.


1105
01:25:36,805 --> 01:25:40,165
And I grew up a little bit like her, Shireen


1106
01:25:40,165 --> 01:25:44,165
where it was always you gotta get things in order, then you come.


1107
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:48,165
No, you come the way you are.


1108
01:25:48,165 --> 01:25:49,045
But I'm a match.


1109
01:25:51,685 --> 01:25:53,285
I don't know why this thought comes to mind


1110
01:25:53,285 --> 01:25:56,645
to tell you I have a my late friend David Wilkerson


1111
01:25:56,645 --> 01:25:58,085
who founded Teen Challenge.


1112
01:25:59,765 --> 01:26:00,645
He was a character.


1113
01:26:01,845 --> 01:26:04,325
When you handed him the microphone to Great Man of God


1114
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,125
you don't know where what could happen.


1115
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,085
What he might say.


1116
01:26:09,525 --> 01:26:11,205
So he's in Poland one day


1117
01:26:11,205 --> 01:26:15,125
and he was at that time he wasn't pastoring Times Square Church.


1118
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:16,085
We was on trips


1119
01:26:16,085 --> 01:26:17,685
and he would we would talk


1120
01:26:17,685 --> 01:26:20,085
and have lunch together and


1121
01:26:20,085 --> 01:26:23,285
and um have a lot of good discussions.


1122
01:26:23,285 --> 01:26:29,605
So one time he was he wouldn't go on a mission trip unless he found some new sermons.


1123
01:26:29,605 --> 01:26:31,045
He didn't like to re-preach sermons.


1124
01:26:32,405 --> 01:26:34,485
So but he w at with this time in his life


1125
01:26:34,485 --> 01:26:37,125
he was reading way too much in the old testament


1126
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,405
and not enough in the new


1127
01:26:38,405 --> 01:26:39,365
and I would tell him that.


1128
01:26:40,405 --> 01:26:42,885
Like, you know, Dave, you're famous.


1129
01:26:42,885 --> 01:26:44,565
You know, Jesus loves you


1130
01:26:44,565 --> 01:26:46,645
Nikki Cruz gets saved, and all this.


1131
01:26:46,645 --> 01:26:52,005
And he was into a lot of this uh prophetic uh old testament bringing out good truths


1132
01:26:52,005 --> 01:26:54,085
but you gotta be careful of that


1133
01:26:54,085 --> 01:26:55,765
as he found out.


1134
01:26:55,765 --> 01:26:59,525
So he was reading in the Old Testament somewhere where it says this.


1135
01:27:00,805 --> 01:27:08,645
All the men in Israel the law says you have to come to Jerusalem three times a year.


1136
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:12,805
You have to come to Jerusalem three times a year to worship at a certain holiday.


1137
01:27:16,325 --> 01:27:17,765
But don't come empty-handed


1138
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:18,725
it says in the law.


1139
01:27:20,565 --> 01:27:23,445
Either Exodus or Deuteronomy, or maybe both.


1140
01:27:23,445 --> 01:27:24,645
Don't come empty-handed.


1141
01:27:24,645 --> 01:27:25,765
You have an offering.


1142
01:27:25,765 --> 01:27:27,205
You bring something.


1143
01:27:27,205 --> 01:27:28,645
God's been good to you.


1144
01:27:28,645 --> 01:27:30,485
You come with something.


1145
01:27:30,485 --> 01:27:32,405
So he told me this himself.


1146
01:27:32,405 --> 01:27:33,525
Maybe he's listening.


1147
01:27:33,525 --> 01:27:35,445
Certainly, God is listening.


1148
01:27:35,445 --> 01:27:38,565
So I'm telling you exactly the way he told it to me.


1149
01:27:38,565 --> 01:27:42,085
And I checked because it was so crazy that what he told me


1150
01:27:42,085 --> 01:27:47,525
I checked with the translator who was a friend of mine before he knew Brother Dave Wilkerson.


1151
01:27:47,525 --> 01:27:51,285
So he's preaching in in in Warsaw, Poland.


1152
01:27:51,285 --> 01:27:54,565
And he's preaching this message about you gotta come.


1153
01:27:54,565 --> 01:27:57,365
See, God, you know what the problem is with a lot of you


1154
01:27:57,365 --> 01:27:59,925
and he's preaching for about fifteen minutes already.


1155
01:27:59,925 --> 01:28:03,765
And the problem with a lot of you is you don't bring anything when you come.


1156
01:28:03,765 --> 01:28:06,085
You have no offering, you have nothing,


1157
01:28:06,085 --> 01:28:09,445
you're selfish, you you this, you're that, but you come


1158
01:28:09,445 --> 01:28:10,565
you gotta come with that.


1159
01:28:10,565 --> 01:28:11,925
Was the point he was making.


1160
01:28:11,925 --> 01:28:14,165
And then as God is listening to me


1161
01:28:14,165 --> 01:28:15,605
we were sitting at Snooky


1162
01:28:15,605 --> 01:28:19,445
we were sitting in Snooky's restaurant on Seventh Avenue in Brooklyn here.


1163
01:28:19,445 --> 01:28:22,725
It used to be a place we ran into a lot.


1164
01:28:22,725 --> 01:28:25,045
And uh he said, Jim, I'm preaching


1165
01:28:25,045 --> 01:28:27,045
and the Holy Spirit speaks to me and says


1166
01:28:27,045 --> 01:28:28,485
Your sermon is totally wrong.


1167
01:28:32,085 --> 01:28:34,325
This is happening while he's preaching.


1168
01:28:34,325 --> 01:28:35,205
Your sermon's wrong.


1169
01:28:36,885 --> 01:28:38,725
Tell the people they don't have to bring anything.


1170
01:28:39,765 --> 01:28:40,885
Just come with their mess.


1171
01:28:41,925 --> 01:28:43,765
Come with their sin.


1172
01:28:43,765 --> 01:28:45,365
Come with their confusion.


1173
01:28:45,365 --> 01:28:46,485
They don't need any


1174
01:28:46,485 --> 01:28:47,285
I don't want


1175
01:28:47,285 --> 01:28:48,645
I don't demand anything.


1176
01:28:48,645 --> 01:28:49,845
You just come.


1177
01:28:49,845 --> 01:28:51,125
I'll fix things up.


1178
01:28:52,165 --> 01:28:54,405
So he's getting this conviction.


1179
01:28:54,405 --> 01:28:59,925
So he turns to the translator and he says, Listen, don't be afraid.


1180
01:28:59,925 --> 01:29:01,765
Just translate every word I'm gonna say.


1181
01:29:03,045 --> 01:29:06,645
So my friend Paul Chestler says yes, and he goes.


1182
01:29:07,765 --> 01:29:11,365
Okay, everyone, the Holy Spirit just stop me in this message.


1183
01:29:11,365 --> 01:29:13,445
Everything I've said is wrong.


1184
01:29:14,645 --> 01:29:18,725
I want you to delete everything in the last 15 minutes.


1185
01:29:18,725 --> 01:29:20,645
Here's what God wants you to know.


1186
01:29:20,645 --> 01:29:22,805
You don't have to come with anything


1187
01:29:22,805 --> 01:29:27,045
you just bring yourself just as I am without one plea


1188
01:29:27,045 --> 01:29:29,285
but that thy blood was shed from me.


1189
01:29:29,285 --> 01:29:31,845
Oh Lamb of God, I come.


1190
01:29:31,845 --> 01:29:34,085
I come just the way I am.


1191
01:29:34,085 --> 01:29:40,885
And my friend Tesla Paul told me people started running to the front.


1192
01:29:40,885 --> 01:29:42,725
Because God loves us so much


1193
01:29:42,725 --> 01:29:44,725
he doesn't say, come with this, come with that,


1194
01:29:44,725 --> 01:29:46,085
fix up this, fix up that.


1195
01:29:46,085 --> 01:29:47,045
He says, just come


1196
01:29:47,045 --> 01:29:48,645
I'll do all the work.


1197
01:29:48,645 --> 01:29:49,445
You just come.


1198
01:29:49,445 --> 01:29:51,525
Can we praise God for that truth?


1199
01:29:57,925 --> 01:29:59,285
So let's close our eyes.


1200
01:30:01,205 --> 01:30:05,285
Anyone here just needs to come, maybe to come back.


1201
01:30:05,285 --> 01:30:06,325
Or just to come.


1202
01:30:06,325 --> 01:30:07,845
Look, look what he says.


1203
01:30:07,845 --> 01:30:09,125
What he promises you.


1204
01:30:09,125 --> 01:30:11,205
He will not violate your free will.


1205
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:14,405
You can totally turn your back on what I'm saying


1206
01:30:14,405 --> 01:30:16,085
and walk out of the church and say


1207
01:30:16,085 --> 01:30:17,365
that was a joke.


1208
01:30:17,365 --> 01:30:18,485
What was that about?


1209
01:30:20,725 --> 01:30:22,405
But if the Holy Spirit is speaking to you


1210
01:30:22,405 --> 01:30:23,765
I plead with you, come.


1211
01:30:26,485 --> 01:30:27,605
Let us pray for you.


1212
01:30:27,605 --> 01:30:29,765
Just come to Jesus.


1213
01:30:29,765 --> 01:30:31,685
Not to the church, not to me.


1214
01:30:31,685 --> 01:30:33,045
I have no power.


1215
01:30:33,045 --> 01:30:36,405
I uh the church is not where the action is.


1216
01:30:36,405 --> 01:30:38,405
Jesus is where the action is.


1217
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:41,285
What he did for Sharem.


1218
01:30:41,285 --> 01:30:42,405
He won't do it for you.


1219
01:30:42,405 --> 01:30:43,925
Well, of course he'll do it for you.


1220
01:30:43,925 --> 01:30:46,165
Your situation's different.


1221
01:30:46,165 --> 01:30:49,045
But he'll get you out of whatever emptiness you're in


1222
01:30:49,045 --> 01:30:50,245
trouble you're in


1223
01:30:50,245 --> 01:30:57,045
depression you're in, aimlessness, bitterness, uncleanness.


1224
01:30:57,045 --> 01:31:00,485
He'll fix it if you'll just please,


1225
01:31:00,485 --> 01:31:03,685
for Christ's sake and your sake, just come.


1226
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:07,685
Anybody want me to pray for them?


1227
01:31:07,685 --> 01:31:09,205
Or to come back?


1228
01:31:09,205 --> 01:31:11,045
You've drifted?


1229
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:12,245
You've drifted?


1230
01:31:12,245 --> 01:31:15,765
Can you be honest enough to say, I have drifted?


1231
01:31:15,765 --> 01:31:18,085
Instead of growing from glory to glory


1232
01:31:18,085 --> 01:31:20,565
I'm I'm going from glory to less glory.


1233
01:31:22,325 --> 01:31:24,725
I want to come back.


1234
01:31:24,725 --> 01:31:26,725
Whether you come or you come back.


1235
01:31:26,725 --> 01:31:29,125
Just stand so I can pray for you.


1236
01:31:30,245 --> 01:31:30,965
Just stand.


1237
01:31:34,005 --> 01:31:35,525
Stand right where you are.


1238
01:32:01,205 --> 01:32:03,765
We're talking good news.


1239
01:32:03,765 --> 01:32:06,085
We're talking come to Jesus.


1240
01:32:07,205 --> 01:32:10,165
We're talking come back to Jesus.


1241
01:32:10,165 --> 01:32:11,365
No, no, no, no.


1242
01:32:11,365 --> 01:32:14,005
I know back 20 years ago, 10 years ago


1243
01:32:14,005 --> 01:32:15,445
when you were in the Caribbean


1244
01:32:15,445 --> 01:32:20,005
or Puerto Rico or Poland or wherever you come from.


1245
01:32:20,005 --> 01:32:22,485
It was, oh, you had these sacred memories.


1246
01:32:22,485 --> 01:32:24,485
What's that got to do with today?


1247
01:32:24,485 --> 01:32:26,485
The Lord is saying, come back.


1248
01:32:26,485 --> 01:32:27,765
Come on, come back.


1249
01:32:30,885 --> 01:32:32,245
Step forward right to the edge.


1250
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:36,965
If you don't come


1251
01:32:36,965 --> 01:32:38,805
he will not violate your free will.


1252
01:35:23,285 --> 01:35:24,885
Didn't you say in your word


1253
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:26,165
if we would just come


1254
01:35:26,165 --> 01:35:28,085
you would do everything?


1255
01:35:28,085 --> 01:35:30,565
Just humble yourself and come.


1256
01:35:30,565 --> 01:35:33,445
Admit you need forgiveness.


1257
01:35:33,445 --> 01:35:34,805
Admit you need help.


1258
01:35:34,805 --> 01:35:35,925
You need cleansing.


1259
01:35:35,925 --> 01:35:36,885
You need strength.


1260
01:35:36,885 --> 01:35:37,685
You need wisdom.


1261
01:35:37,685 --> 01:35:39,765
You need things to be fixed.


1262
01:35:39,765 --> 01:35:41,765
I'm standing next to a woman, Lord


1263
01:35:41,765 --> 01:35:48,325
who came to you and you turned the world upside down for her to get her out of trouble.


1264
01:35:48,325 --> 01:35:50,405
What an awesome God you are.


1265
01:35:54,085 --> 01:35:56,325
Folks here in the front


1266
01:35:56,325 --> 01:35:57,605
with your eyes closed


1267
01:35:57,605 --> 01:36:02,165
just repeat this prayer coming from my heart, my mouth.


1268
01:36:02,165 --> 01:36:03,845
But I want you to repeat it


1269
01:36:03,845 --> 01:36:05,685
and claim it as your own.


1270
01:36:05,685 --> 01:36:06,565
Make it your own.


1271
01:36:06,565 --> 01:36:08,965
Talk from your heart.


1272
01:36:08,965 --> 01:36:09,925
Dear God.


1273
01:36:11,925 --> 01:36:12,885
Dear God.


1274
01:36:14,165 --> 01:36:15,765
I'm coming home.


1275
01:36:16,965 --> 01:36:18,565
I'm coming to you.


1276
01:36:20,645 --> 01:36:23,205
I shouldn't have done it a long time ago.


1277
01:36:24,645 --> 01:36:27,205
But now I'm tired.


1278
01:36:27,205 --> 01:36:28,645
I'm coming home.


1279
01:36:31,605 --> 01:36:33,205
Fix what's broken.


1280
01:36:35,925 --> 01:36:37,605
Please what's dirty.


1281
01:36:40,645 --> 01:36:42,725
Take away my confusion.


1282
01:36:44,085 --> 01:36:45,765
Fill my emptiness.


1283
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:51,525
I'm living, I'm striving, I'm working


1284
01:36:51,525 --> 01:36:53,685
I'm saving money


1285
01:36:53,685 --> 01:36:55,125
and I'm empty.


1286
01:36:56,165 --> 01:36:57,285
Without you.


1287
01:36:59,365 --> 01:37:00,885
I'm coming home.


1288
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:04,645
Should have never left.


1289
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:08,485
Thank you for sharing.


1290
01:37:10,085 --> 01:37:12,245
And the word of God.


1291
01:37:12,245 --> 01:37:13,605
I'm coming home.


1292
01:37:14,725 --> 01:37:15,605
I'm gonna rest.


1293
01:37:19,285 --> 01:37:21,205
With my hand on your breast.


1294
01:37:26,485 --> 01:37:28,405
Encourage me.


1295
01:37:28,405 --> 01:37:30,165
You know how hard it's been.


1296
01:37:33,365 --> 01:37:34,725
But now I'm whole.


1297
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:41,605
I believe in you, Jesus.


1298
01:37:41,605 --> 01:37:45,765
I claim you as my Savior and my Lord.


1299
01:37:45,765 --> 01:37:48,805
I believe you are the Son of God.


1300
01:37:48,805 --> 01:37:51,925
You died under Pontius Pilate.


1301
01:37:51,925 --> 01:37:53,685
But on the third day


1302
01:37:53,685 --> 01:37:55,925
you were raised from the dead.


1303
01:37:55,925 --> 01:37:57,605
You're alive.


1304
01:37:57,605 --> 01:37:58,885
You're here.


1305
01:37:58,885 --> 01:38:00,245
You're with me.


1306
01:38:00,245 --> 01:38:01,525
You love me.


1307
01:38:01,525 --> 01:38:03,045
You're for me.


1308
01:38:03,045 --> 01:38:05,125
You're not against me.


1309
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:06,565
That's the good news.


1310
01:38:08,325 --> 01:38:09,605
That's why I'm coming home.


1311
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,405
Now lift up that right hand.


1312
01:38:12,405 --> 01:38:14,085
Just lift that right hand up.


1313
01:38:14,085 --> 01:38:14,485
Sing.
