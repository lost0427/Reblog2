For we are so unworthy to even call your name.


371
00:37:24,655 --> 00:37:30,280
And don't let our coming be in vain.


372
00:37:56,989 --> 00:38:08,193
Give us your Spirit, your Holy Spirit, right now.


373
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:20,917
Spirit, Spirit of Christ.


374
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:40,740
On me Oh spirit Spirit Spirit Oh spirit On me Oh fall down


375
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:59,956
Fall down Fall down Holy Spirit, fall down.


376
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:02,518
Fall down.


377
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:10,263
Holy Spirit, fall down.


378
00:39:10,263 --> 00:39:12,405
Fall down.


379
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,244
Fall down Fall down Fall down


380
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:30,749
We need the Holy Spirit right now.


381
00:40:44,194 --> 00:41:17,750
Spirit of Spirit of Lift your hands.


382
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,511
Close your eyes.


383
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:23,132
Lord, we love you.


384
00:41:38,627 --> 00:41:41,849
Come in me, God.


385
00:41:47,753 --> 00:41:57,759
Oh, rest on me.


386
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,461
Come on, break me, melt me.


387
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:02,703
Break me.


388
00:42:49,544 --> 00:42:52,467
If you're hungry for more of the Spirit of God


389
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:55,450
just stand up where you're sitting and sing break me.


390
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,511
Just stand and sing.


391
00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:58,133
Everyone, sing.


392
00:42:58,133 --> 00:42:58,813
And break.


393
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:55,574
to live freely with you to live freely with you to live freely with you Lord


394
00:43:55,574 --> 00:43:58,756
there's people standing who are hungry to be used by you.


395
00:44:01,277 --> 00:44:03,318
Will you send them in full-time ministry?


396
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:05,839
Will they be missionaries?


397
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,460
They have some function in the body of Christ, Lord


398
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,721
and we're hungry to be used by you.


399
00:44:11,852 --> 00:44:14,093
We want to be blessed so we can be a blessing.


400
00:44:14,093 --> 00:44:17,175
We don't want bless just to be blessed.


401
00:44:17,175 --> 00:44:18,416
We want to pass it on.


402
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:20,737
We want the overflow to go to others, Lord.


403
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:23,559
So although we have the Holy Spirit


404
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:24,940
we need the Holy Spirit.


405
00:44:27,682 --> 00:44:28,482
Fill us, Lord.


406
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:30,283
Fill us.


407
00:44:31,784 --> 00:44:32,645
Move among us.


408
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,307
Tenderize us.


409
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:41,210
Take away pride and selfishness and get us focused.


410
00:44:42,588 --> 00:44:44,749
on the harvest fields that are ripe, Lord.


411
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:46,970
Use us all.


412
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,011
We pray this in Jesus' name.


413
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:54,232
And everyone said, amen.


414
00:44:54,232 --> 00:44:55,252
You may be seated.


415
00:44:55,252 --> 00:44:58,273
You may be seated.


416
00:44:58,273 --> 00:44:59,994
Let's thank God for the choir.


417
00:44:59,994 --> 00:45:02,255
Can we put our hands together for the choir?


418
00:45:05,476 --> 00:45:09,737
So remember in your giving


419
00:45:09,737 --> 00:45:10,678
remember in your giving


420
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,651
We have offering baskets out there


421
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:18,192
but those of you giving online who don't live near here


422
00:45:18,192 --> 00:45:24,414
and we're going to give you more information soon about our prayer.


423
00:45:24,414 --> 00:45:25,795
We're not calling it the prayer band


424
00:45:25,795 --> 00:45:26,995
but it's our prayer team.


425
00:45:26,995 --> 00:45:30,656
It's made up of people who are watching online


426
00:45:30,656 --> 00:45:31,737
who can't get out


427
00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:34,958
or for whatever reason they feel involved here.


428
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,939
But you should find a local church where you are.


429
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:40,380
But if you want to be part of the prayer team


430
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,701
we're going to give you a way.


431
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:45,384
A way to, you'll get requests from us and you just pray for


432
00:45:45,384 --> 00:45:47,506
just like the prayer band people pray.


433
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:48,526
That'll be a good thing.


434
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:50,948
It's always good for people to pray.


435
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:51,909
Amen?


436
00:45:51,909 --> 00:45:54,491
Men ought always to pray and never quit, give up.


437
00:45:55,892 --> 00:45:57,753
Men ought always, and women ought to give


438
00:45:57,753 --> 00:45:59,635
because God loves a cheerful giver.


439
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:00,416
And the truth is


440
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:03,838
the work of God goes on through the giving of God's people.


441
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:06,240
Not by millionaires and billionaires.


442
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,144
They can sometimes come and do something special.


443
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:12,305
But it's the regular giving of God's people


444
00:46:12,305 --> 00:46:15,326
that helps God's work go on all throughout the earth.


445
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:18,407
How many believe, as the Bible teaches


446
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:20,748
that everything you have comes from God?


447
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:21,748
Just lift your hand.


448
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:23,349
Lift your hand if you believe that.


449
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:24,489
Everything.


450
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:25,010
Your clothes?


451
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,591
Your house, your apartment you live in?


452
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:30,512
The bed you slept in last night?


453
00:46:30,512 --> 00:46:32,012
The food you ate today?


454
00:46:32,012 --> 00:46:32,892
It all came from God.


455
00:46:33,913 --> 00:46:38,245
So we should honor him back with a portion of that.


456
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:39,806
And I encourage you to do that.


457
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:42,747
My wife is a giver.


458
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:45,088
I married a giver.


459
00:46:45,088 --> 00:46:49,389
My mom, my dad was a little bit until he started drinking.


460
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,630
And then he was an alcoholic for 22 years


461
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,691
so he didn't think about giving anything.


462
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:56,112
He was just out of control.


463
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:56,892
But I had a mom


464
00:46:56,892 --> 00:47:00,714
no matter what was going on with my dad, she kept giving, tithing.


465
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:04,595
Oh my goodness, what an example she was to me


466
00:47:04,595 --> 00:47:06,856
and my older brother and my younger sister.


467
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:10,248
So be an example, be a giver


468
00:47:10,248 --> 00:47:11,249
and you'll get happy.


469
00:47:11,249 --> 00:47:14,650
Oh, you're trying to psych us.


470
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,531
No, no, I'm quoting the Bible.


471
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:19,752
It is more blessed to receive.


472
00:47:19,752 --> 00:47:21,413
You know why a lot of people are depressed?


473
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:22,274
They don't give anything.


474
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:24,114
They're cheaper than a crab.


475
00:47:25,315 --> 00:47:28,576
They're tighter than a crab or whatever that saying is.


476
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:31,518
But when you give


477
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:32,578
it frees you up.


478
00:47:32,578 --> 00:47:33,839
You can have the joy of the Lord.


479
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:34,099
Amen.


480
00:47:36,209 --> 00:47:40,070
So please, as you leave or as you give online, help us.


481
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,130
So today we were blessed this morning.


482
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,331
I just want to honor him.


483
00:47:46,371 --> 00:47:51,812
Speaking for us this morning was a dear friend and his wife, my wife and I


484
00:47:53,692 --> 00:47:56,373
, Pastor Ken Witten and Ginny, his wife.


485
00:47:56,373 --> 00:48:03,984
They live in Florida, and on March 10, 2020, uh carol


486
00:48:03,984 --> 00:48:08,447
and i went down for five days ostensibly to stay in florida real quick


487
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:12,790
we got a call the next day do not move don't get on an airplane


488
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:19,055
covet has hit big time they're shutting everything down the church can't meet publicly shutting the offices down


489
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:20,136
schools down


490
00:48:20,136 --> 00:48:26,240
everything's down people are being brought to hospitals ventilators you know that nightmare we went through


491
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:30,483
so i was in florida the the pastors


492
00:48:30,483 --> 00:48:31,824
and the board called me stay


493
00:48:31,824 --> 00:48:34,327
where you are Stay in place.


494
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:35,068
For how long?


495
00:48:35,068 --> 00:48:36,488
No one knows.


496
00:48:36,488 --> 00:48:38,129
You remember back then, right?


497
00:48:38,129 --> 00:48:39,269
No one knew what was going to happen.


498
00:48:40,689 --> 00:48:43,030
So my friend, Ken Witten, who I knew


499
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,211
called me that next day.


500
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:47,752
And after they had talked to me and said


501
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:48,832
what are you going to do, Jim?


502
00:48:48,832 --> 00:48:50,132
I hear you're here in Florida.


503
00:48:50,132 --> 00:48:50,933
I said, yeah, I'm stuck.


504
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:54,694
I don't know how long


505
00:48:54,694 --> 00:48:56,574
and what we're going to do.


506
00:48:56,574 --> 00:48:58,395
So he said, no, listen


507
00:48:58,395 --> 00:49:00,556
you got to keep your Sunday services


508
00:49:00,556 --> 00:49:01,971
even though you're not open.


509
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:07,314
So take my auditorium, a massive auditorium


510
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:10,917
and I'll give you my videography team, more important.


511
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:12,998
And you come during the morning day


512
00:49:12,998 --> 00:49:14,619
and then you let them tape you


513
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:20,123
and you preach a sermon for the church to be played on Sunday.


514
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,764
Then my wife took and gathered worship songs


515
00:49:22,764 --> 00:49:25,366
and worship times from previous meetings.


516
00:49:25,366 --> 00:49:28,048
So every Sunday for 16 months.


517
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:31,126
We were shut for 16 months.


518
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:32,047
How many remember that?


519
00:49:32,047 --> 00:49:32,767
Anyone remember?


520
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:34,128
16 months.


521
00:49:35,649 --> 00:49:39,612
And it was all made possible by that.


522
00:49:39,612 --> 00:49:40,512
But he did more.


523
00:49:40,512 --> 00:49:42,233
He was prophetic.


524
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:46,716
He said, I have a feeling New York's going to need this more than just a Sunday.


525
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:48,978
What you should do is


526
00:49:48,978 --> 00:49:50,259
after you tape your sermon


527
00:49:50,259 --> 00:49:52,600
go up to this other studio we have.


528
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,322
Same three, four guys.


529
00:49:54,322 --> 00:49:56,223
These are professional videographers.


530
00:49:57,324 --> 00:49:59,125
And do some daily devotions.


531
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:02,032
You know, seven, eight minutes long.


532
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,353
And just try to stay in front of the people every day.


533
00:50:04,353 --> 00:50:05,695
It's going to be hard up there, Jim.


534
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:07,556
And I was like


535
00:50:07,556 --> 00:50:09,058
thank you so much.


536
00:50:09,058 --> 00:50:09,878
So it started.


537
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:11,580
It went on for 16 months.


538
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,722
It continued since I've come back.


539
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:15,123
Because now there's a following


540
00:50:15,123 --> 00:50:18,666
and people watching from around the country and the world.


541
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:22,289
And now, as I tape five more this week


542
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:23,990
I'll have hit the milestone.


543
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,991
I've done 1,500 daily devotions.


544
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:30,214
And we thank God just for his faithfulness.


545
00:50:31,574 --> 00:50:35,756
So it all started with Pastor Ken Whitten


546
00:50:35,756 --> 00:50:38,978
that church where he was pastoring then.


547
00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:41,159
And you think he would take any money?


548
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:41,779
Nope.


549
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,020
I tried every angle.


550
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,181
No, let us give you.


551
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:48,582
No, no, no, no, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.


552
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:49,463
It's our donation.


553
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,703
It's our gift.


554
00:50:50,703 --> 00:50:56,886
Someone has said to me what he gave you in labor and in services.


555
00:50:58,952 --> 00:51:00,453
at least $250,000, $400,000.


556
00:51:00,453 --> 00:51:05,836
Because when you make videos


557
00:51:05,836 --> 00:51:07,617
you have to pay people big money, right?


558
00:51:09,638 --> 00:51:11,900
And he preached this morning with such a blessing.


559
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,881
And Pastor Ken and Jenny


560
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:15,222
would you just stand up?


561
00:51:15,222 --> 00:51:17,983
I want the church to give you the loudest welcome.


562
00:51:17,983 --> 00:51:18,424
Come on.


563
00:51:19,704 --> 00:51:20,725
Come on, let them hear it!


564
00:51:20,725 --> 00:51:22,066
Brooklyn!


565
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,242
So let's go back.


566
00:51:32,242 --> 00:51:34,143
So while I'm in Florida there


567
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:36,966
they have more religious channels than we have.


568
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:43,151
And my wife and I are watching NRB, the National Religious Broadcasters Network.


569
00:51:43,151 --> 00:51:44,912
And there's a guy preaching


570
00:51:44,912 --> 00:51:49,616
and it says Pacific Garden Mission, Chicago, downtown.


571
00:51:49,616 --> 00:51:54,520
Any of you familiar here with the Bowery Mission?


572
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,813
The Bowery, okay.


573
00:51:55,813 --> 00:52:00,275
So you have street people, people hurting, people very transient.


574
00:52:01,696 --> 00:52:02,856
And there's this guy.


575
00:52:04,197 --> 00:52:07,518
I liked him immediately when I saw his name, Kwiatkowski.


576
00:52:07,518 --> 00:52:08,218
That's Polish.


577
00:52:08,218 --> 00:52:08,999
I'm half Polish.


578
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:11,580
Our people have to stay together


579
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,181
the few of us that are left.


580
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:18,963
But my goodness, my wife said, Jim, listen to that.


581
00:52:18,963 --> 00:52:20,363
That's such a good word.


582
00:52:21,984 --> 00:52:22,624
Am I right, Carol?


583
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:26,957
She said, why don't you try to contact him?


584
00:52:26,957 --> 00:52:28,298
Would he ever come to Brooklyn?


585
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:29,898
I said, I don't know.


586
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:30,798
Then I saw him again.


587
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:32,198
Then I saw him another time.


588
00:52:33,198 --> 00:52:34,599
And every time he blessed me.


589
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:36,719
So I got the courage up to reach out


590
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,839
because I'm shy to call people I don't know.


591
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:41,300
And I called him.


592
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,500
We finally connected.


593
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,560
I said, would you come on a Sunday


594
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,741
and feed the people the word of God?


595
00:52:47,741 --> 00:52:54,129
And I don't know how long he's been down doing that down in Chicago.


596
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,709
But he is going to give us, like this morning


597
00:52:56,709 --> 00:53:00,790
how many want spiritual steak, potatoes, gravy?


598
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:03,151
Come on, how many want a good meal?


599
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:07,871
Put your hands together loud for my friend, Pastor Philip Kwiatkowski.


600
00:53:10,712 --> 00:53:13,412
Thank you.


601
00:53:13,412 --> 00:53:15,533
Thank you so much.


602
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:17,693
Well, praise God.


603
00:53:17,693 --> 00:53:18,553
What a blessing.


604
00:53:18,553 --> 00:53:21,594
How many people are familiar with the Pacific Garden Mission?


605
00:53:21,594 --> 00:53:23,157
Anybody in here?


606
00:53:23,157 --> 00:53:23,457
Amen.


607
00:53:23,457 --> 00:53:25,198
Let's hear an amen for PGM.


608
00:53:25,198 --> 00:53:25,578
Amen.


609
00:53:26,759 --> 00:53:28,760
How about Radio Unshackled?


610
00:53:30,261 --> 00:53:32,242
Well, that's at Pacific Garden Mission.


611
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:36,324
We still tape it live every Saturday at 3 o'clock.


612
00:53:36,324 --> 00:53:37,445
A live audience has come.


613
00:53:37,445 --> 00:53:43,848
And those are stories of lives that have been changed by the gospel of Jesus Christ.


614
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:45,709
So it's an amazing ministry.


615
00:53:45,709 --> 00:53:49,051
And I'm here with my wife of almost 38 years.


616
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:50,252
Ann, stand up if you would.


617
00:53:50,252 --> 00:53:50,792
Ann, come on.


618
00:53:57,078 --> 00:54:00,180
I met her when we were students at Moody Bible Institute in 1987.


619
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,883
I met her in, I think, March of 87.


620
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:04,804
I married her in December of 87.


621
00:54:05,945 --> 00:54:07,206
I said, she's so pretty


622
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:08,628
I can't let her change her mind


623
00:54:08,628 --> 00:54:09,748
so we did it quick.


624
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:13,472
And here we are, four kids, and 38 years later.


625
00:54:13,472 --> 00:54:15,353
Let's go ahead and look to the Lord in prayer


626
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:16,354
and then we'll get into the Word.


627
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:19,597
Father, thank you for this opportunity to be here.


628
00:54:19,597 --> 00:54:20,378
And I pray, God


629
00:54:20,378 --> 00:54:22,483
as we open up your Word


630
00:54:22,483 --> 00:54:24,884
We are not here to hear from Phil or any man.


631
00:54:24,884 --> 00:54:26,584
We want to hear from you.


632
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:32,945
There's people in this building this morning that need to hear from you.


633
00:54:32,945 --> 00:54:36,506
Jesus, may you be glorified in all that's spoken


634
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,207
I pray in Jesus' name.


635
00:54:38,207 --> 00:54:38,567
Amen.


636
00:54:40,307 --> 00:54:44,028
Years ago, I was sitting in a board meeting at the Pacific Garden Mission


637
00:54:44,028 --> 00:54:46,289
and we were gathered around a table


638
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:51,690
and suddenly water began to drip down on the table that we were seated at.


639
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:54,422
Oh, we didn't know what was going on


640
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:58,544
so we ran upstairs and there was an old mail room up there.


641
00:54:58,544 --> 00:55:01,065
And one of the sinks, slop sinks


642
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:03,226
was overflowing and the faucet was running.


643
00:55:03,226 --> 00:55:06,908
But the guy that was there monitoring the mail room


644
00:55:06,908 --> 00:55:09,249
he had a mop bucket out.


645
00:55:09,249 --> 00:55:11,730
He was mopping up the water.


646
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,871
But somebody said to him


647
00:55:12,871 --> 00:55:15,112
why don't you turn the faucet off, man?


648
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:17,813
That always stuck with me.


649
00:55:18,813 --> 00:55:20,274
Because I think of what we do


650
00:55:20,274 --> 00:55:21,875
and I think there's so many of us


651
00:55:23,015 --> 00:55:26,617
That we spend our life with a mop bucket.


652
00:55:26,617 --> 00:55:29,438
We go relationship to relationship.


653
00:55:29,438 --> 00:55:31,659
We go to this church to that church.


654
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:33,540
This job to that job.


655
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,721
We go to this podcast to the other.


656
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:37,702
We're always looking for answers


657
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:43,284
but we never really deal with the heart of the issue.


658
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:47,326
You know, when I first came to the Pacific Guard Admission


659
00:55:47,326 --> 00:55:48,227
I was a young man


660
00:55:48,227 --> 00:55:49,591
as I said at the time.


661
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:51,873
Out of Moody Bible Institute


662
00:55:51,873 --> 00:55:54,374
1988 is when I came.


663
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:58,837
And to me, the answers were so much more simplistic.


664
00:55:58,837 --> 00:56:01,139
My wife and myself did a lot of street ministry.


665
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:05,101
We'd go around and witness on the street and share the gospel.


666
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:06,162
And I came to the mission.


667
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,544
That was a great joy.


668
00:56:08,544 --> 00:56:09,504
But when I got there


669
00:56:09,504 --> 00:56:12,526
and saw the lives of the men and women


670
00:56:12,526 --> 00:56:13,687
my eyes were opened up.


671
00:56:13,687 --> 00:56:18,170
Because it was so much deeper than just seeing people come to Jesus.


672
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,222
And hear me this morning.


673
00:56:20,222 --> 00:56:22,145
It's not just about getting saved.


674
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,486
There's many people in here.


675
00:56:23,486 --> 00:56:26,330
You've made decisions to accept Christ.


676
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,352
You've repented of your sin.


677
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:30,455
You've accepted Jesus as your Savior.


678
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:32,758
But man, you struggle.


679
00:56:33,779 --> 00:56:37,423
You struggle with issues in your life.


680
00:56:37,423 --> 00:56:39,684
And maybe on the outside you look great


681
00:56:39,684 --> 00:56:42,444
and you know how to smile and play the game


682
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:44,304
and you can do everything the right way.


683
00:56:44,304 --> 00:56:50,406
But inside, internally, you are absolutely crying out because you are struggling.


684
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:55,447
Why do I do the things that I do?


685
00:56:55,447 --> 00:56:58,307
And I saw men and women that were like that.


686
00:56:58,307 --> 00:57:01,357
I saw people come out of jail and penitentiary.


687
00:57:01,357 --> 00:57:02,758
People that were living in the streets


688
00:57:02,758 --> 00:57:06,481
and struggling with cocaine or heroin addiction and now fentanyl.


689
00:57:06,481 --> 00:57:08,082
I've seen so many overdoses.


690
00:57:08,082 --> 00:57:13,626
We have Narcon and have to train our staff on how to administer Narcon and all these things.


691
00:57:13,626 --> 00:57:16,708
But when you scrape away all the issues


692
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:20,411
and get down to the core, hear me


693
00:57:20,411 --> 00:57:21,612
there's a hurting person.


694
00:57:23,433 --> 00:57:25,775
I had a driver one time who was telling me


695
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:30,216
and this guy was just struggling and he was always angry.


696
00:57:30,216 --> 00:57:31,816
And it's a phrase that many of us heard


697
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:32,797
but when he said it to me


698
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:34,077
it just spoke to me.


699
00:57:34,077 --> 00:57:37,118
He said, Pastor, hurting people hurt people.


700
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:40,159
And I always remember that.


701
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:41,939
Hurting people hurt people.


702
00:57:41,939 --> 00:57:42,740
What do you do?


703
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,100
I remember years ago


704
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,560
there was a man by the name of Thomas.


705
00:57:46,621 --> 00:57:49,802
He came to us and he was on drugs and incarcerated.


706
00:57:49,802 --> 00:57:51,722
He had tattoos all over his body.


707
00:57:53,163 --> 00:57:55,744
In the story he told me, He said


708
00:57:55,744 --> 00:57:58,386
my father gave me heroin


709
00:57:58,386 --> 00:58:02,128
when I was two years old to shut me up from crying.


710
00:58:02,128 --> 00:58:05,289
How do you process that?


711
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,971
What do you say?


712
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:09,832
Praise God, let's sing this hymn today.


713
00:58:09,832 --> 00:58:10,972
This is a great song.


714
00:58:10,972 --> 00:58:13,834
What do you tell somebody that tells you something like that?


715
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:17,736
One of our counselors came to me out of the day room


716
00:58:17,736 --> 00:58:21,978
and he said there was a man in the day room and he showed the counselor


717
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:26,336
he said his mother dipped him in boiling water as a child.


718
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:32,580
He had scars from his waist down.


719
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,361
And he's sitting in a homeless shelter


720
00:58:34,361 --> 00:58:37,162
and there he is and the world is going by him.


721
00:58:37,162 --> 00:58:38,063
It's not just, you know


722
00:58:38,063 --> 00:58:42,605
get yourself up by your bootstraps, buddy, and just go get a job and stuff.


723
00:58:42,605 --> 00:58:46,167
He is trying to process the pain.


724
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:51,570
You know, that's a phrase I've heard from so many people.


725
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,569
I use drugs.


726
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:57,051
Because I'm trying to dull the pain.


727
00:58:58,051 --> 00:58:59,812
So this morning as we're here


728
00:58:59,812 --> 00:59:01,193
I want all of us


729
00:59:01,193 --> 00:59:03,574
and we are in church, praise God.


730
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:05,995
We are where God wants us to be.


731
00:59:05,995 --> 00:59:09,657
Maybe somebody brought you and maybe you have to be here, whatever it is.


732
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:11,738
But I want you to listen


733
00:59:11,738 --> 00:59:14,359
because I believe God wants to say something to you.


734
00:59:15,439 --> 00:59:17,440
And some of us this morning


735
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,622
we don't know why we do the things that we do.


736
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:25,213
Outwardly speaking, we might look great


737
00:59:25,213 --> 00:59:27,235
say the right words, do the right things.


738
00:59:27,235 --> 00:59:31,058
There's a story of a man I want to look at tonight or this afternoon.


739
00:59:31,058 --> 00:59:34,201
His man's name is Ahithophel.


740
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:37,303
Ahithophel was a successful man.


741
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:40,106
He was a man that people probably wanted to emulate.


742
00:59:41,212 --> 00:59:44,315
A man that was a counselor to the kings.


743
00:59:44,315 --> 00:59:46,356
From all outward trappings


744
00:59:46,356 --> 00:59:48,538
this man was a success.


745
00:59:48,538 --> 00:59:49,639
But inside of him


746
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:51,601
he had something going on.


747
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:54,823
Some unresolved issue that he never dealt with.


748
00:59:54,823 --> 00:59:57,606
He did not know how to process the pain.


749
00:59:57,606 --> 00:59:59,487
And so though he lived his life


750
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:03,751
he really didn't know how to do it or how to handle it.


751
01:00:03,751 --> 01:00:05,172
What happened to Hippothel?


752
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:06,233
Well, one day he went home.


753
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,051
And he hung himself.


754
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:11,353
Now let me read this to you from 2 Samuel 17, 23.


755
01:00:13,374 --> 01:00:16,197
When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed


756
01:00:16,197 --> 01:00:18,759
he saddled his ass and rose


757
01:00:18,759 --> 01:00:21,200
and he went to his house, to his city


758
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,382
and put his household in order


759
01:00:23,382 --> 01:00:27,265
and hanged himself and died


760
01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:31,308
and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.


761
01:00:32,709 --> 01:00:35,091
Could you imagine if you were in Israel at the time


762
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:37,254
and The whispers that people would say


763
01:00:37,254 --> 01:00:40,856
what in the world happened to a hippophile?


764
01:00:40,856 --> 01:00:45,017
Listen to what the Bible says about a hippophile when he would counsel people.


765
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:49,658
The Bible says in 2 Samuel 16, 23, In the counsel of a hippophile


766
01:00:49,658 --> 01:00:51,639
which he counseled in those days


767
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:57,181
was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God.


768
01:00:58,233 --> 01:01:03,594
So was all the counsel of Ahithophel, both with David and with Absalom.


769
01:01:03,594 --> 01:01:07,055
And Ahithophel was the king's counselor.


770
01:01:07,055 --> 01:01:10,696
You talk about a position of prestige


771
01:01:10,696 --> 01:01:17,597
and honor and dignity for you to be the counselor to the king.


772
01:01:17,597 --> 01:01:21,958
Oh, I'm sure when that man walked into family gatherings


773
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:24,178
he was met with much fanfare.


774
01:01:24,178 --> 01:01:27,100
Here comes Ahithophel, counselor to the king.


775
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,921
You know who I am, all right?


776
01:01:28,921 --> 01:01:29,742
There he is.


777
01:01:31,003 --> 01:01:34,445
But what in the world happened


778
01:01:34,445 --> 01:01:38,048
where this man got so desperate


779
01:01:38,048 --> 01:01:41,450
that he hung himself and took his own life?


780
01:01:42,811 --> 01:01:46,434
Well, Ahithophel made some interesting decisions


781
01:01:46,434 --> 01:01:47,495
and let me read this to you.


782
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:51,657
2 Samuel 15, verse 12.


783
01:01:51,657 --> 01:01:53,659
And Absalom sent for Ahithophel


784
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:55,080
and some of you know the Bible story.


785
01:01:56,173 --> 01:01:59,714
King David's son Absalom wanted to have a coup


786
01:01:59,714 --> 01:02:01,614
and take over the throne from his father.


787
01:02:02,654 --> 01:02:08,156
So he gathered together a bunch of individuals that went to Jerusalem and David had to flee.


788
01:02:09,156 --> 01:02:12,016
So when Ahithophel wanted to know what to do


789
01:02:12,016 --> 01:02:14,577
what is the course of action he should take?


790
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:15,837
What person do you think


791
01:02:15,837 --> 01:02:17,698
that he called and asked advice?


792
01:02:17,698 --> 01:02:20,298
Ahithophel.


793
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:22,078
Man, that guy's smart.


794
01:02:22,078 --> 01:02:24,479
That guy knows his stuff.


795
01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:26,340
So it says here


796
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,402
and this is Absalom sent for Ahithophel, the Gileadite


797
01:02:29,402 --> 01:02:32,385
, David's counselor from his city, even from Gilo


798
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:34,286
while he offered sacrifices.


799
01:02:34,286 --> 01:02:39,510
And the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with Absalom.


800
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,851
And one told David, saying


801
01:02:40,851 --> 01:02:43,914
Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.


802
01:02:43,914 --> 01:02:44,915
And David was shocked.


803
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:47,437
David, this is your guy.


804
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:52,123
Your guy, Ahithophel, now he's supporting your son.


805
01:02:52,123 --> 01:02:55,085
And I'm sure the news struck David's heart.


806
01:02:55,085 --> 01:02:55,906
What in the world?


807
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:57,928
This was my guy.


808
01:02:57,928 --> 01:03:01,712
This was the guy that I was with that I sought his advice and counsel from.


809
01:03:02,729 --> 01:03:05,150
And now he is with my son


810
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:08,032
and he's gathering together and giving counsel against me.


811
01:03:08,032 --> 01:03:10,634
And listen to his counsel here.


812
01:03:10,634 --> 01:03:12,115
Terrible, terrible stuff.


813
01:03:12,115 --> 01:03:13,275
2 Samuel 16, 15.


814
01:03:14,736 --> 01:03:16,857
And Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel


815
01:03:16,857 --> 01:03:20,739
came to Jerusalem and Ahithophel with him.


816
01:03:20,739 --> 01:03:22,681
Then Absalom said to Ahithophel


817
01:03:22,681 --> 01:03:25,862
give counsel among you what we shall do.


818
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,184
Absalom says to him


819
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,003
what shall we do?


820
01:03:31,003 --> 01:03:33,023
What counsel do you advise?


821
01:03:33,023 --> 01:03:35,764
What course of action shall I take?


822
01:03:36,804 --> 01:03:39,885
And Ahithophel said to Absalom


823
01:03:39,885 --> 01:03:42,645
Go and unto thy father's concubines


824
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:45,385
which he hath left to keep the house.


825
01:03:45,385 --> 01:03:47,206
And all Israel shall hear


826
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:49,106
that you are abhorred of your father.


827
01:03:49,106 --> 01:03:52,467
Then all the hands that are with you shall be strong.


828
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:56,227
Go ahead and violate David's wives.


829
01:03:57,508 --> 01:04:00,148
I mean, where did this advice come from?


830
01:04:01,577 --> 01:04:04,140
You are not only doing this to David


831
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,781
a man that you serve


832
01:04:05,781 --> 01:04:08,865
you are ruining the lives of these women.


833
01:04:08,865 --> 01:04:12,468
But not only that, moreover


834
01:04:12,468 --> 01:04:14,210
Ahithophel said to Absalom


835
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:14,891
and listen to this


836
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,695
let me now choose out 12,000 men


837
01:04:18,695 --> 01:04:22,719
and I will arise and pursue after David this night.


838
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:27,213
And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed


839
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:28,694
and I will make him afraid.


840
01:04:28,694 --> 01:04:32,016
And all the people that are with him shall flee


841
01:04:32,016 --> 01:04:34,538
and I will kill the king only.


842
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:38,141
I mean, think about that.


843
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:40,022
You're a counselor.


844
01:04:40,022 --> 01:04:45,406
Your advice is you personally want to go out with a group of men


845
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:49,289
and you personally want to kill the king.


846
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:53,052
Seems like there's another dynamic going on here.


847
01:04:54,122 --> 01:04:56,884
As I said earlier, this man


848
01:04:56,884 --> 01:04:59,526
from all outward trappings


849
01:04:59,526 --> 01:05:01,247
seemed to have it all.


850
01:05:02,247 --> 01:05:04,249
But inside of him there was something going on.


851
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:06,570
Some of us, again


852
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:10,833
as I said earlier, outside, we look good.


853
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:12,074
We can say the right thing


854
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:12,774
do the right thing


855
01:05:12,774 --> 01:05:13,955
but inside of us


856
01:05:15,396 --> 01:05:18,938
things that we have never told some of our closest friends


857
01:05:18,938 --> 01:05:22,670
that we have never confided in anybody about, Man


858
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:24,391
we are struggling with


859
01:05:24,391 --> 01:05:27,313
and I don't know how to process the pain.


860
01:05:27,313 --> 01:05:30,395
That was happening with him.


861
01:05:30,395 --> 01:05:32,216
How do you know that?


862
01:05:33,657 --> 01:05:35,378
What happened to Ahithophel?


863
01:05:35,378 --> 01:05:36,879
Why did he do this?


864
01:05:36,879 --> 01:05:40,141
Let me read you from 2 Samuel 11, verse 3.


865
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:44,704
And David sent and inquired after the woman, this is Bathsheba.


866
01:05:45,805 --> 01:05:49,788
And someone said, is this not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Iliam?


867
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,320
the wife of Uriah the Hittite.


868
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:58,562
So Bathsheba's father's name was Iliam.


869
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,563
Well, let me look at 2 Samuel 23-34.


870
01:06:03,563 --> 01:06:08,664
And Iliam, the son of Ahithophel.


871
01:06:09,904 --> 01:06:14,065
Bathsheba was Ahithophel's granddaughter.


872
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:18,768
And I believe when that issue happened to Bathsheba


873
01:06:18,768 --> 01:06:21,170
that's something that a hippophile never forgot.


874
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,631
He didn't know how to process it.


875
01:06:23,752 --> 01:06:28,764
He had my grandson-in-law murdered coldly, brutally.


876
01:06:28,764 --> 01:06:31,808
He took my granddaughter and he violated her


877
01:06:31,808 --> 01:06:33,850
and he busted up this relationship.


878
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:35,953
And then he took her to himself into the home.


879
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:39,157
And that's something that he never knew how to process.


880
01:06:39,157 --> 01:06:41,640
And for years, I'm sure he struggled with it.


881
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,062
He went to bed with it.


882
01:06:43,062 --> 01:06:44,303
He thought about it.


883
01:06:44,303 --> 01:06:45,965
And finally, when the time arose.


884
01:06:47,061 --> 01:06:49,343
When Absalom rose up and says


885
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:52,105
I'm going to defeat David, Hippothel said


886
01:06:52,105 --> 01:06:53,106
you count me in.


887
01:06:53,106 --> 01:06:58,250
Matter of fact, you go ahead and violate his wives as he violated my granddaughter.


888
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,612
Matter of fact, when you send somebody to kill him


889
01:07:00,612 --> 01:07:02,294
I'm the one that's going to go out there.


890
01:07:02,294 --> 01:07:04,415
Let me slay King David.


891
01:07:04,415 --> 01:07:05,957
And then all of a sudden


892
01:07:05,957 --> 01:07:08,138
when those things didn't work out


893
01:07:08,138 --> 01:07:09,239
he didn't know what to do.


894
01:07:11,001 --> 01:07:11,881
So he hung himself.


895
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:13,723
And he died.


896
01:07:14,913 --> 01:07:17,754
What in the world happened to this man?


897
01:07:18,995 --> 01:07:22,516
He was bitter, angry, and frustrated.


898
01:07:23,536 --> 01:07:24,837
Hear me tonight, or this morning.


899
01:07:25,997 --> 01:07:27,738
I usually preach at night at the mission


900
01:07:27,738 --> 01:07:29,318
so I say night.


901
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:35,921
But there's a lot of us here this morning that are struggling with issues in our life


902
01:07:35,921 --> 01:07:38,842
and there is a distinction between salvation.


903
01:07:40,027 --> 01:07:43,130
We've made the decision to accept Jesus Christ.


904
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:45,252
Maybe there's some here that have not done that


905
01:07:45,252 --> 01:07:46,914
and I would encourage you to do that


906
01:07:46,914 --> 01:07:48,956
because that's where it starts.


907
01:07:48,956 --> 01:07:50,617
It's not about religion or church.


908
01:07:50,617 --> 01:07:52,739
It's about you coming to Jesus Christ.


909
01:07:54,561 --> 01:07:57,584
But if you've done that, still inside now


910
01:07:57,584 --> 01:07:59,979
it's the process of growth.


911
01:07:59,979 --> 01:08:05,184
What do I do with certain events that have transpired in the past?


912
01:08:05,184 --> 01:08:05,925
Now listen to this.


913
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:08,067
Matthew 18 is a tremendous story.


914
01:08:08,067 --> 01:08:09,908
We won't read the whole story.


915
01:08:09,908 --> 01:08:11,790
About a man that was forgiven much


916
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:14,993
but he held a grudge against somebody else.


917
01:08:14,993 --> 01:08:15,854
Listen to this quickly.


918
01:08:15,854 --> 01:08:16,915
Matthew 18, 32.


919
01:08:17,996 --> 01:08:21,499
Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, Oh, you wicked servant


920
01:08:21,499 --> 01:08:25,542
I forgave all the debt because you desired me.


921
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:29,344
Shouldest not thou had also compassion on your fellow servants


922
01:08:29,344 --> 01:08:31,385
even as I had pity on you?


923
01:08:31,385 --> 01:08:33,426
And his Lord was angry


924
01:08:33,426 --> 01:08:35,587
and delivered him to the tormentors


925
01:08:35,587 --> 01:08:37,809
till he should pay all that was due him.


926
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:41,451
So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you


927
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:46,894
if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.


928
01:08:46,894 --> 01:08:47,494
Powerful!


929
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:50,755
If you, and it doesn't, again


930
01:08:50,755 --> 01:08:52,197
when we talk about forgiveness


931
01:08:52,197 --> 01:08:54,699
and we're going to deal with this in a moment


932
01:08:54,699 --> 01:08:56,520
forgiveness is not about you jumping down


933
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,943
and singing kumbaya with somebody that hurt you.


934
01:08:59,943 --> 01:09:03,826
It's not holding their hand like pretending something never happened.


935
01:09:03,826 --> 01:09:04,827
It did happen.


936
01:09:04,827 --> 01:09:10,012
There's things that have happened in this room to people that is incredibly painful.


937
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:14,555
One of our workers upstairs told me, it's either, she said, 95% or 100%


938
01:09:17,311 --> 01:09:21,532
of our women at the shelter have been abused in some form or fashion.


939
01:09:22,952 --> 01:09:30,874
And there they are at a shelter trying to process having their innocence taken


940
01:09:30,874 --> 01:09:39,056
their personhood violated by somebody they trusted and they held so dear.


941
01:09:39,056 --> 01:09:43,357
Trying to make sense of a world that fell apart around them.


942
01:09:43,357 --> 01:09:44,298
And the question is


943
01:09:44,298 --> 01:09:45,218
what do you do?


944
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:48,714
And Jesus comes along and says


945
01:09:48,714 --> 01:09:50,935
you need to forgive people from your


946
01:09:50,935 --> 01:09:52,396
what does it say?


947
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:52,716
Heart.


948
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:56,258
Because if you don't


949
01:09:56,258 --> 01:10:00,100
it says you'll be handed over to the tormentors.


950
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,580
See, I like when you talk back, amen?


951
01:10:03,221 --> 01:10:05,862
I don't believe if you're born again you lose your salvation


952
01:10:05,862 --> 01:10:07,083
but I believe what that is


953
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:11,285
if we live a life of unforgiveness, plainly speaking


954
01:10:12,484 --> 01:10:17,985
If we have not resolved some of those issues that have happened to us


955
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:19,885
there's going to be consequences.


956
01:10:21,326 --> 01:10:27,867
If we have never learned how to process the pain, dull the emotion, deal with the situation.


957
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:29,047
If we walk away


958
01:10:29,047 --> 01:10:30,648
I can't stand that person.


959
01:10:30,648 --> 01:10:33,268
And all of us know people like that.


960
01:10:34,268 --> 01:10:35,429
When you hear uncle such


961
01:10:35,429 --> 01:10:37,289
and such is coming to the Christmas party.


962
01:10:38,383 --> 01:10:40,464
thoughts about this guy.


963
01:10:40,464 --> 01:10:42,725
Class reunion, I can't stand that guy.


964
01:10:42,725 --> 01:10:45,826
I just don't like them.


965
01:10:45,826 --> 01:10:48,187
Let's just be honest.


966
01:10:48,187 --> 01:10:53,269
And some of us can dredge up memories of things that transpired and we struggle with it.


967
01:10:53,269 --> 01:10:55,910
But hear me, there are consequences.


968
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:59,011
And Jesus said you'll be handed over to the tormentors.


969
01:10:59,011 --> 01:11:01,732
There's consequences to not forgiving.


970
01:11:03,193 --> 01:11:06,510
Quickly, some of the tormentors might be relational.


971
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:08,932
I think if a man say I love God and hates his brother


972
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:10,013
he's a liar.


973
01:11:10,013 --> 01:11:12,075
For he that loves his brother whom he has seen


974
01:11:12,075 --> 01:11:14,137
how can he love God whom he has not seen?


975
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:16,980
So relationally, I'm going to struggle.


976
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,562
If I can't stand somebody else


977
01:11:19,562 --> 01:11:21,864
how can I say I love a God that I've never seen?


978
01:11:21,864 --> 01:11:24,186
So maybe the issue


979
01:11:24,186 --> 01:11:26,989
like the illustration that I talked about when we opened up


980
01:11:26,989 --> 01:11:30,772
you're mopping up relationships with a bucket.


981
01:11:30,772 --> 01:11:32,830
Man, I'm on my... Third marriage.


982
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:37,432
You know, I can't keep a relationship straight.


983
01:11:37,432 --> 01:11:38,853
Person to person.


984
01:11:38,853 --> 01:11:40,754
And we're looking for answers


985
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:43,035
but the answer is not in the mop bucket.


986
01:11:43,035 --> 01:11:44,956
It's going to the source.


987
01:11:44,956 --> 01:11:47,297
Maybe those are some of the tormentors


988
01:11:47,297 --> 01:11:51,219
and the reason that I am doing what I am doing


989
01:11:51,219 --> 01:11:53,661
that God wants me to deal with today.


990
01:11:53,661 --> 01:11:57,183
Not only relational, emotional.


991
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:57,783
Check this out.


992
01:11:57,783 --> 01:11:58,303
Ephesians 4.31.


993
01:11:58,303 --> 01:11:59,084
Let all bitterness.


994
01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:02,805
It's powerful.


995
01:12:02,805 --> 01:12:03,766
Let all bitterness.


996
01:12:03,766 --> 01:12:06,928
Bitterness, I believe, is the main river from


997
01:12:06,928 --> 01:12:09,649
which the rest of these tributaries flow from.


998
01:12:09,649 --> 01:12:12,671
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger


999
01:12:12,671 --> 01:12:13,731
and anger is interesting.


1000
01:12:13,731 --> 01:12:14,952
There's people in here this morning


1001
01:12:14,952 --> 01:12:16,433
we struggle with anger.


1002
01:12:16,433 --> 01:12:19,154
There's a guy I'd known from the mission


1003
01:12:19,154 --> 01:12:22,656
and he said when he first got married, and hear this advice.


1004
01:12:22,656 --> 01:12:24,197
Him and his wife got into it one day


1005
01:12:24,197 --> 01:12:25,638
and he looked at his wife and he said


1006
01:12:25,638 --> 01:12:27,699
you make me so angry.


1007
01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:30,680
Anybody ever hear that before?


1008
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,481
It's your fault.


1009
01:12:32,504 --> 01:12:34,486
You make me angry.


1010
01:12:34,486 --> 01:12:35,988
And she calmly looked at him and said


1011
01:12:35,988 --> 01:12:37,069
I don't make you angry.


1012
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,611
She said, you are angry.


1013
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:42,394
You've been angry your whole life.


1014
01:12:42,394 --> 01:12:43,535
That didn't make him angrier.


1015
01:12:43,535 --> 01:12:44,276
You'd think that it would.


1016
01:12:46,058 --> 01:12:47,959
But he went and thought about it.


1017
01:12:47,959 --> 01:12:48,600
He said, you're right.


1018
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,303
I'm angry because of my lot in life.


1019
01:12:51,303 --> 01:12:54,071
I'm angry because of what happened in my family.


1020
01:12:54,071 --> 01:12:54,932
And he lists all these


1021
01:12:54,932 --> 01:12:56,973
I'm just angry at this and angry at that.


1022
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:59,394
And maybe some of us this morning, you say


1023
01:12:59,394 --> 01:13:01,156
this person makes me angry.


1024
01:13:01,156 --> 01:13:02,957
This situation makes me angry.


1025
01:13:02,957 --> 01:13:04,278
This boss is no good.


1026
01:13:04,278 --> 01:13:05,839
I can't stand all this stuff.


1027
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:08,160
And maybe it's not all this stuff that makes you angry.


1028
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:12,903
I have to ask the question instead of mopping all this stuff, go to the source and say


1029
01:13:12,903 --> 01:13:16,365
why am I angry?


1030
01:13:16,365 --> 01:13:18,787
And that's what the Bible says.


1031
01:13:18,787 --> 01:13:21,349
Let all bitterness and wrath


1032
01:13:21,349 --> 01:13:26,928
and anger And loudness and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.


1033
01:13:26,928 --> 01:13:29,410
And I love God's remedy.


1034
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:33,633
Be kind one to another, tenderhearted for forgiving one another.


1035
01:13:35,254 --> 01:13:36,735
See, when we look at this mop bucket


1036
01:13:36,735 --> 01:13:39,356
we try to take medication.


1037
01:13:39,356 --> 01:13:41,158
We go to therapy.


1038
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:42,819
We go to all these different things


1039
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,980
but we never really get to the source


1040
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:47,602
because all of a sudden when the medication wears off


1041
01:13:48,602 --> 01:13:49,002
All of a sudden


1042
01:13:49,002 --> 01:13:52,806
we are still there with the problems that we always had


1043
01:13:52,806 --> 01:13:54,687
and God wants us to get to the source.


1044
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,149
And he says, emotionally.


1045
01:13:57,478 --> 01:14:01,981
There's people you've struggled with your emotions, relationally,


1046
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:06,524
personally, vocationally, in every area of your life


1047
01:14:06,524 --> 01:14:07,745
and you wonder why.


1048
01:14:07,745 --> 01:14:09,546
And so you get a mop bucket out.


1049
01:14:09,546 --> 01:14:11,768
If I just listen to this podcast


1050
01:14:11,768 --> 01:14:13,469
if I just buy this book


1051
01:14:13,469 --> 01:14:17,151
if I just take this drug over here.


1052
01:14:17,151 --> 01:14:17,852
And some of us


1053
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:18,832
we like to go ahead


1054
01:14:18,832 --> 01:14:22,535
and maybe we dull ourselves with drugs that we shouldn't be using.


1055
01:14:22,535 --> 01:14:24,857
Why do I do what I do?


1056
01:14:28,738 --> 01:14:31,760
The answer there is forgiveness.


1057
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,701
That's what Jesus said.


1058
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:37,925
And he says, not only that, it's spiritually.


1059
01:14:37,925 --> 01:14:40,968
Mark 11, 25, and when you stand praying


1060
01:14:40,968 --> 01:14:43,470
forgive if you have anything against any


1061
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:47,653
that your Father which is in heaven may forgive you your sins.


1062
01:14:47,653 --> 01:14:48,834
So what are the tormentors?


1063
01:14:48,834 --> 01:14:51,817
I believe the tormentors are relational, emotional, spiritual


1064
01:14:51,817 --> 01:14:52,818
maybe there's other ones.


1065
01:14:52,818 --> 01:14:54,499
And there's some of us in here this morning


1066
01:14:54,499 --> 01:14:55,760
those are the things we struggle with.


1067
01:14:57,089 --> 01:14:58,929
Man, Christmas is coming, Thanksgiving is coming.


1068
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:01,270
I don't want to be at my family party.


1069
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,270
I don't want to be around people.


1070
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:03,250
That uncle's loud.


1071
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,851
I don't want to do this over here, that.


1072
01:15:04,851 --> 01:15:06,351
And we just struggle with stuff.


1073
01:15:06,351 --> 01:15:07,871
And we're wondering, God


1074
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:08,812
what's the answer?


1075
01:15:08,812 --> 01:15:12,453
Could it be something transpired


1076
01:15:12,453 --> 01:15:14,833
that you yet have never processed?


1077
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:15,913
And here's the heart of


1078
01:15:15,913 --> 01:15:17,374
where I want to go this morning.


1079
01:15:17,374 --> 01:15:19,554
Ephesians 4, 26.


1080
01:15:19,554 --> 01:15:20,854
Listen to this.


1081
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:22,935
Be ye angry and what?


1082
01:15:25,135 --> 01:15:28,396
So it tells me anger is normal.


1083
01:15:28,396 --> 01:15:30,857
I mean, as Christians


1084
01:15:30,857 --> 01:15:31,958
let's not pretend.


1085
01:15:33,058 --> 01:15:36,019
We drive, we get angry, amen?


1086
01:15:36,019 --> 01:15:38,762
I mean, anger happens.


1087
01:15:38,762 --> 01:15:41,603
And some of us have been angry at what happened to us.


1088
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:42,763
You were violated.


1089
01:15:42,763 --> 01:15:44,543
Your innocence was stolen.


1090
01:15:44,543 --> 01:15:47,864
Your parent maybe picked your sibling as their favorite.


1091
01:15:47,864 --> 01:15:49,224
You were overlooked.


1092
01:15:49,224 --> 01:15:50,925
Injustice happened to you.


1093
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:53,545
There's real situations that happen in your life


1094
01:15:53,545 --> 01:15:54,926
and you were angry.


1095
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:57,746
You were mad.


1096
01:15:57,746 --> 01:16:00,587
What do you do?


1097
01:16:00,587 --> 01:16:03,668
It says, be angry and what?


1098
01:16:03,668 --> 01:16:04,408
Sin not, but hear.


1099
01:16:05,693 --> 01:16:09,034
Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.


1100
01:16:09,034 --> 01:16:14,116
It tells me there should be a completion date to anger.


1101
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:17,118
And that's the problem.


1102
01:16:17,118 --> 01:16:20,159
Some of us went to bed angry.


1103
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,180
Don't let the sun go down upon your wrath.


1104
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:25,121
But when we let the sun go down upon our wrath


1105
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:26,021
what do we begin to do?


1106
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:26,962
We begin to nurse it.


1107
01:16:28,302 --> 01:16:29,663
Man, we think it over in our mind.


1108
01:16:29,663 --> 01:16:31,664
I can't stand that person.


1109
01:16:31,664 --> 01:16:33,544
Why'd they do that to me?


1110
01:16:33,544 --> 01:16:35,897
I'll never go around that person again.


1111
01:16:35,897 --> 01:16:37,258
I'll never trust them again.


1112
01:16:37,258 --> 01:16:38,859
And we rehearse it.


1113
01:16:38,859 --> 01:16:40,239
And we rehearse it.


1114
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:41,320
And we rehearse it.


1115
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,721
So we go to bed angry.


1116
01:16:42,721 --> 01:16:46,223
And then the next verse says, neither give place to where?


1117
01:16:46,223 --> 01:16:48,084
To where?


1118
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:54,367
So if you go to bed angry, scripturally speaking


1119
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:56,508
you are giving place to who?


1120
01:16:57,669 --> 01:17:03,352
Now the word place means a spot, location, position, home, a room.


1121
01:17:05,069 --> 01:17:06,531
Think about that.


1122
01:17:06,531 --> 01:17:10,096
You are giving the enemy a room.


1123
01:17:10,096 --> 01:17:14,293
Inside, you are ceding ground to the enemy.


1124
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:17,255
That violation that happened to you


1125
01:17:17,255 --> 01:17:19,377
that you don't know how to process


1126
01:17:19,377 --> 01:17:25,261
that you're trying to mop up your whole life, running everywhere to and fro looking for answers


1127
01:17:25,261 --> 01:17:28,103
and now that you've given the devil a place


1128
01:17:28,103 --> 01:17:30,044
and then I think of 2 Corinthians 10, 4


1129
01:17:30,044 --> 01:17:32,826
for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal,


1130
01:17:32,826 --> 01:17:37,550
but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds.


1131
01:17:39,151 --> 01:17:44,012
That's ground you've ceded to the enemy.


1132
01:17:44,012 --> 01:17:46,835
How did you cede ground to the enemy?


1133
01:17:46,835 --> 01:17:49,497
By going to bed, what?


1134
01:17:49,497 --> 01:17:50,618
Angry.


1135
01:17:50,618 --> 01:17:52,580
And you gave him a place.


1136
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:55,222
And now he operates out of that place.


1137
01:17:55,222 --> 01:17:57,244
And all these things come from it.


1138
01:17:57,244 --> 01:18:03,870
Relationships, addiction, drug, promiscuity, and all these things.


1139
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:06,452
And I'm saying this to you this morning


1140
01:18:06,452 --> 01:18:09,035
because as I talk to people every day


1141
01:18:09,035 --> 01:18:10,076
that's what I've seen.


1142
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:12,592
There was a guy a number of years ago.


1143
01:18:12,592 --> 01:18:13,413
His name was Michael.


1144
01:18:13,413 --> 01:18:16,135
Incredibly talented pianist.


1145
01:18:16,135 --> 01:18:17,476
Classically trained.


1146
01:18:17,476 --> 01:18:18,837
Unbelievable.


1147
01:18:18,837 --> 01:18:21,018
But man, he could never get it right.


1148
01:18:21,018 --> 01:18:22,119
In the mission, out of the mission.


1149
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:23,300
In the mission, out of the mission.


1150
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,401
On drugs, off drugs.


1151
01:18:24,401 --> 01:18:25,041
On drugs, off drugs.


1152
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:25,702
Same old thing.


1153
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:29,764
And I finally asked him about his background and he said, well, what happened?


1154
01:18:29,764 --> 01:18:32,827
He was raised by his mother initially


1155
01:18:32,827 --> 01:18:35,388
and then his mother had a new boyfriend.


1156
01:18:35,388 --> 01:18:37,750
So the boyfriend gave the mother an ultimatum.


1157
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:38,551
It's either him or me.


1158
01:18:40,368 --> 01:18:42,512
And the mother chose the boyfriend.


1159
01:18:43,835 --> 01:18:46,299
And he said, now my auntie raised me.


1160
01:18:46,299 --> 01:18:48,703
And my auntie was kind of like a Cruella de Vil


1161
01:18:48,703 --> 01:18:51,099
and she was mean and overbearing.


1162
01:18:51,099 --> 01:18:53,040
She'd make me play the piano day and night.


1163
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,020
I'd look out of the window


1164
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,761
and see all the other kids playing football and basketball.


1165
01:18:56,761 --> 01:18:58,882
But I was never allowed to go with the other boys.


1166
01:18:58,882 --> 01:19:01,643
I was forced to sit into this room to play piano.


1167
01:19:01,643 --> 01:19:02,503
And now at the time


1168
01:19:02,503 --> 01:19:03,824
he was an older man.


1169
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:07,225
He's still asking questions about his childhood.


1170
01:19:07,225 --> 01:19:12,907
Why in the world did my mother choose the boyfriend over me?


1171
01:19:12,907 --> 01:19:17,009
And you look at his life from outward, like a hippophile, a success.


1172
01:19:17,009 --> 01:19:18,009
What's wrong with you?


1173
01:19:18,009 --> 01:19:18,970
You're articulate.


1174
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:19,610
You're smart.


1175
01:19:20,691 --> 01:19:21,812
You have a skill.


1176
01:19:21,812 --> 01:19:23,453
You're a great piano player.


1177
01:19:23,453 --> 01:19:25,335
Why can't you ever get it together?


1178
01:19:25,335 --> 01:19:29,579
You can mop it up by going to a drug treatment program, going to this program


1179
01:19:29,579 --> 01:19:31,460
talking to this counselor, doing this.


1180
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:34,003
You need to get to the source.


1181
01:19:34,003 --> 01:19:38,587
And the source, I need to process what happened to me.


1182
01:19:38,587 --> 01:19:43,631
And I need, by the grace of God, learn how to forgive.


1183
01:19:43,631 --> 01:19:45,173
That's what happens there.


1184
01:19:51,631 --> 01:19:52,611
I think of Hebrews 12, 15.


1185
01:19:54,112 --> 01:19:57,653
The Bible says, looking diligently


1186
01:19:57,653 --> 01:20:03,696
lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness spring up trouble you


1187
01:20:03,696 --> 01:20:07,397
thereby many are defiled.


1188
01:20:07,397 --> 01:20:08,938
Hallelujah.


1189
01:20:08,938 --> 01:20:10,299
Think about that.


1190
01:20:10,299 --> 01:20:12,640
Bitterness defiles people.


1191
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,961
And so how does bitterness happen?


1192
01:20:14,961 --> 01:20:16,759
You go to bed angry.


1193
01:20:16,759 --> 01:20:18,540
They give the devil a place.


1194
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,641
This place becomes a grudge.


1195
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:23,062
This grudge becomes unforgiveness.


1196
01:20:23,062 --> 01:20:24,963
Unforgiveness becomes bitterness.


1197
01:20:24,963 --> 01:20:26,644
And now I'm bitter and I just hate everything.


1198
01:20:26,644 --> 01:20:28,465
Do you ever meet people that just hate everything?


1199
01:20:28,465 --> 01:20:31,106
Not nice people to hang around with.


1200
01:20:31,106 --> 01:20:31,646
That's no good.


1201
01:20:31,646 --> 01:20:32,126
That stinks.


1202
01:20:32,126 --> 01:20:32,967
It's too hot.


1203
01:20:32,967 --> 01:20:33,487
It's too cold.


1204
01:20:33,487 --> 01:20:34,628
It's no good.


1205
01:20:34,628 --> 01:20:35,428
And just bitter.


1206
01:20:35,428 --> 01:20:36,528
No matter what you talk about.


1207
01:20:36,528 --> 01:20:39,070
They're just bitter people.


1208
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:41,691
And bitterness defiles you.


1209
01:20:41,691 --> 01:20:44,152
And that's where it has its source.


1210
01:20:44,152 --> 01:20:46,634
Somebody once says unforgiveness.


1211
01:20:46,634 --> 01:20:51,578
is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.


1212
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:54,100
Think about that.


1213
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:59,524
Some of you can't stand somebody for what they've done to you


1214
01:20:59,524 --> 01:21:02,346
but they've moved on with their life.


1215
01:21:02,346 --> 01:21:08,751
And you are seated here dealing with the consequences of their filthy, vile actions.


1216
01:21:08,751 --> 01:21:10,712
And I want to tell you this morning


1217
01:21:10,712 --> 01:21:12,053
by the grace of God


1218
01:21:12,053 --> 01:21:15,928
it is time for you to move on.


1219
01:21:15,928 --> 01:21:18,869
They've already violated you once.


1220
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:20,590
They shouldn't do it a second time.


1221
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:26,732
Real quick, I asked some of our folks in our drug program before I came here last week


1222
01:21:26,732 --> 01:21:27,972
and I asked about forgiveness.


1223
01:21:28,972 --> 01:21:31,313
This one says, I had a problem with forgiving


1224
01:21:31,313 --> 01:21:36,595
because of what was done to me at the time from this person.


1225
01:21:36,595 --> 01:21:38,376
I was constantly in misery.


1226
01:21:40,661 --> 01:21:42,002
Why are you miserable?


1227
01:21:42,002 --> 01:21:45,725
You need to get a happy space, a time out


1228
01:21:45,725 --> 01:21:46,685
go to the fun zone


1229
01:21:46,685 --> 01:21:47,886
whatever you want to do.


1230
01:21:47,886 --> 01:21:48,547
No.


1231
01:21:48,547 --> 01:21:50,428
The reason I'm miserable is


1232
01:21:51,989 --> 01:21:54,851
because of what somebody has done to me.


1233
01:21:55,872 --> 01:22:01,824
And they sit today in Chicago on a drug program trying to process the pain.


1234
01:22:01,824 --> 01:22:03,004
Somebody else wrote down


1235
01:22:03,004 --> 01:22:07,185
I had a very hard time forgiving my father who was abusive.


1236
01:22:07,185 --> 01:22:09,906
He was an alcoholic and abused my siblings.


1237
01:22:09,906 --> 01:22:13,947
And I frequently, physically, all the time and verbally.


1238
01:22:13,947 --> 01:22:17,827
And he says, it stole my joy for years.


1239
01:22:19,548 --> 01:22:24,249
Somebody else says, I still have a lot of work to do.


1240
01:22:24,249 --> 01:22:26,370
The emotions are powerful.


1241
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:28,011
I need a lot of help.


1242
01:22:28,011 --> 01:22:30,511
The pain runs dry


1243
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:31,752
deeper than I can control.


1244
01:22:31,752 --> 01:22:33,032
Listen to this.


1245
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:36,634
The pain gives power to my addiction.


1246
01:22:38,034 --> 01:22:42,996
The pain gives power to my addiction.


1247
01:22:44,716 --> 01:22:45,557
And as I read that


1248
01:22:45,557 --> 01:22:47,657
I was thinking about that.


1249
01:22:47,657 --> 01:22:49,998
How many of us in here


1250
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:53,736
does the pain that we have been through


1251
01:22:53,736 --> 01:22:59,101
Really give what we're struggling with the power to have mastery over us?


1252
01:23:00,482 --> 01:23:01,563
You know, so again


1253
01:23:01,563 --> 01:23:05,046
when we deal with this topic of forgiveness


1254
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,468
and bitterness as we wind up


1255
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,471
forgiveness is not a feeling.


1256
01:23:11,512 --> 01:23:14,254
You're not going to feel warm fuzzies about a certain person.


1257
01:23:14,254 --> 01:23:14,995
Yay!


1258
01:23:14,995 --> 01:23:16,656
There's no yay.


1259
01:23:16,656 --> 01:23:19,719
Forgiveness does not mean pretending you were not hurt.


1260
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:20,420
You were hurt.


1261
01:23:21,938 --> 01:23:23,238
You were violated.


1262
01:23:23,238 --> 01:23:24,859
What was done to you was wrong.


1263
01:23:24,859 --> 01:23:26,239
The hurt was real.


1264
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:27,520
The pain exists.


1265
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,460
And it happened.


1266
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:32,381
Forgiveness is not condoning what they did.


1267
01:23:32,381 --> 01:23:33,941
It doesn't mean when you forgive


1268
01:23:33,941 --> 01:23:35,782
that it means everything is okay.


1269
01:23:35,782 --> 01:23:37,322
Somehow that they get a free pass.


1270
01:23:37,322 --> 01:23:37,762
They don't.


1271
01:23:38,903 --> 01:23:42,103
Forgiveness does not mean reconciliation.


1272
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:46,325
Joseph did not reconcile with his brothers.


1273
01:23:46,325 --> 01:23:48,285
Read that story in the book of Genesis later on.


1274
01:23:48,285 --> 01:23:48,965
Great story.


1275
01:23:48,965 --> 01:23:50,306
It's a whole other sermon.


1276
01:23:50,306 --> 01:23:51,833
We're not going there.


1277
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:52,814
But think about this.


1278
01:23:52,814 --> 01:23:55,776
Joseph sold into slavery by his own brothers.


1279
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:58,719
They come back to visit him and Joseph sees them.


1280
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,520
He doesn't run down and say, Kumbaya.


1281
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,781
Hey, guys, all good now.


1282
01:24:01,781 --> 01:24:02,682
I'm second to Pharaoh.


1283
01:24:02,682 --> 01:24:04,143
Hey, look at my chariot.


1284
01:24:04,143 --> 01:24:06,766
Well, now he has go back.


1285
01:24:06,766 --> 01:24:08,047
It's Benjamin.


1286
01:24:08,047 --> 01:24:12,390
And he singles out Benjamin and he singles him out.


1287
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:14,913
He recreates what happened to him.


1288
01:24:16,274 --> 01:24:17,935
My friend, as we're closing


1289
01:24:17,935 --> 01:24:19,977
I want to give an illustration to you as we close.


1290
01:24:21,261 --> 01:24:24,923
When I think of the whole story of forgiveness.


1291
01:24:24,923 --> 01:24:29,526
In South America, there's a group of individuals that want to catch these monkeys.


1292
01:24:30,846 --> 01:24:32,627
And what they do is they have these canisters.


1293
01:24:33,688 --> 01:24:34,849
And they put these candies


1294
01:24:34,849 --> 01:24:37,010
and treats on the bottom of these canisters.


1295
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:41,953
So when the monkeys put the hands down and grab the treats


1296
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:44,014
they can't get their hand back up again.


1297
01:24:44,014 --> 01:24:45,495
They're caught.


1298
01:24:45,495 --> 01:24:47,696
Everything would change if they simply did what?


1299
01:24:48,977 --> 01:24:49,197
What?


1300
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:52,517
Everybody, let's say it together.


1301
01:24:52,517 --> 01:24:52,880
Let it go.


1302
01:24:54,893 --> 01:24:57,394
And there's some of us here this morning


1303
01:24:57,394 --> 01:25:00,476
the devil has had a field day with you.


1304
01:25:00,476 --> 01:25:06,199
Relationally, emotionally, spiritually, you are struggling because you are violated


1305
01:25:06,199 --> 01:25:07,380
you are in pain


1306
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:09,341
you don't know how to process the pain


1307
01:25:09,341 --> 01:25:11,042
and you sit here this morning.


1308
01:25:11,042 --> 01:25:13,743
It's not another therapy session you need.


1309
01:25:13,743 --> 01:25:15,804
It's not another podcast that you need.


1310
01:25:15,804 --> 01:25:22,028
What you need to do, plain and simple this morning, is hallelujah, let it go!


1311
01:25:23,969 --> 01:25:26,070
It is time.


1312
01:25:28,711 --> 01:25:33,893
God maybe brought you here this morning for you to hear that.


1313
01:25:33,893 --> 01:25:36,274
You've been in pain long enough.


1314
01:25:36,274 --> 01:25:38,455
You've rehearsed that long enough.


1315
01:25:38,455 --> 01:25:41,356
This morning you need to let it go.


1316
01:25:41,356 --> 01:25:43,217
Let's have every head bowed


1317
01:25:43,217 --> 01:25:45,537
and every eye closed as we close the service.


1318
01:25:45,537 --> 01:25:46,258
Every head bowed.


1319
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:49,719
Maybe as you're here this morning


1320
01:25:49,719 --> 01:25:51,700
and the prayer counselors are going to come down


1321
01:25:53,184 --> 01:25:57,390
Maybe you've never accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.


1322
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:59,072
Somebody brought you to church and you said


1323
01:25:59,072 --> 01:25:59,873
I've been in pain.


1324
01:26:01,173 --> 01:26:03,434
You need forgiveness.


1325
01:26:03,434 --> 01:26:04,755
I'm not saying join a church.


1326
01:26:04,755 --> 01:26:06,336
It's not good people that go to heaven


1327
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,937
and bad people that go to hell.


1328
01:26:07,937 --> 01:26:09,418
It's forgiven people.


1329
01:26:09,418 --> 01:26:12,179
It's sinners that cry out to a holy Savior.


1330
01:26:12,179 --> 01:26:13,580
Say, Pastor, this morning


1331
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,041
I need to be forgiven.


1332
01:26:15,041 --> 01:26:16,322
I need Jesus.


1333
01:26:16,322 --> 01:26:18,083
Raise up your hand all through the auditorium.


1334
01:26:18,083 --> 01:26:19,503
I need to be born again.


1335
01:26:19,503 --> 01:26:20,284
I need to be saved.


1336
01:26:20,284 --> 01:26:21,204
A number of hands.


1337
01:26:21,204 --> 01:26:22,925
Hallelujah.


1338
01:26:22,925 --> 01:26:25,347
Maybe that's why you're here.


1339
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,368
You've been trying to process the pain.


1340
01:26:27,368 --> 01:26:29,129
And the answer is as simple as Jesus.


1341
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:31,982
Those of you with your hands raised


1342
01:26:31,982 --> 01:26:35,165
I want you to pray with me in the quietness of your heart.


1343
01:26:35,165 --> 01:26:37,286
Say, Dear God, I know that I am a sinner.


1344
01:26:37,286 --> 01:26:41,189
I believe Jesus Christ died for my sin.


1345
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:44,452
And this morning I repent of my sin


1346
01:26:44,452 --> 01:26:49,556
and I accept Jesus Christ as my Savior.


1347
01:26:50,577 --> 01:26:52,058
In Jesus' name, Amen.


1348
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:55,080
We're going to sing a closing hymn.


1349
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,722
It's called Just As I Am.


1350
01:26:57,743 --> 01:26:59,323
It's a hymn that I always close


1351
01:26:59,323 --> 01:27:02,444
when I close a service at the mission.


1352
01:27:02,444 --> 01:27:03,045
But if you're here


1353
01:27:03,045 --> 01:27:03,745
why don't we all stand


1354
01:27:03,745 --> 01:27:04,965
and we'll sing this together.


1355
01:27:04,965 --> 01:27:07,526
The front is open here.


1356
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:10,307
Again, hear me this morning.


1357
01:27:11,347 --> 01:27:13,107
So we just don't play church.


1358
01:27:13,107 --> 01:27:15,048
We walk out the door.


1359
01:27:15,048 --> 01:27:16,908
Some of you were spoken to this morning.


1360
01:27:18,189 --> 01:27:18,989
You know who you are.


1361
01:27:18,989 --> 01:27:20,109
God spoke to your heart.


1362
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,210
You need to let it go.


1363
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:25,131
And as we sing this song


1364
01:27:25,131 --> 01:27:27,137
just as I am


1365
01:27:27,137 --> 01:27:31,022
Why don't you come down here, pray with somebody, come to the altar.


1366
01:27:31,022 --> 01:27:32,924
This is your time.


1367
01:27:32,924 --> 01:27:35,487
The devil has had a field day with you.


1368
01:27:35,487 --> 01:27:40,933
And what you need to do, let it go.


1369
01:27:40,933 --> 01:27:43,156
So why don't you come on down, let's sing.


1370
01:27:47,186 --> 01:27:53,011
Why don't you come down today?


1371
01:27:53,011 --> 01:27:58,696
Come on down, come on down.


1372
01:27:58,696 --> 01:28:02,820
You know God has spoken to your heart this morning.


1373
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,981
Hallelujah, hallelujah.


1374
01:28:03,981 --> 01:28:07,084
It is time this morning, hallelujah.


1375
01:28:07,084 --> 01:28:09,106
Come on down, come on down.


1376
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,062
You've lived with the pain for too long.


1377
01:28:13,062 --> 01:28:16,445
You don't know how to process what happened to you.


1378
01:28:16,445 --> 01:28:17,346
You struggle.


1379
01:28:17,346 --> 01:28:19,948
I want to tell you there's a God who loves you.


1380
01:28:19,948 --> 01:28:23,931
There's a Savior who shed His blood for you.


1381
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:26,052
Hallelujah.


1382
01:28:26,052 --> 01:28:28,614
Come on down.


1383
01:28:32,477 --> 01:28:33,658
Anybody else tonight?


1384
01:28:33,658 --> 01:28:34,419
Come on down.


1385
01:28:37,342 --> 01:28:41,185
Just as I am, day and night.


1386
01:28:41,185 --> 01:28:44,127
Maybe some of the balcony


1387
01:28:44,127 --> 01:28:47,549
maybe you're wrestling with it.


1388
01:28:47,549 --> 01:28:51,131
Why don't you come to Jesus today?


1389
01:28:51,131 --> 01:28:54,254
Come on down, come on down.


1390
01:28:54,254 --> 01:29:00,638
My soul, I want my life to be.


1391
01:29:05,785 --> 01:29:14,590
Come on, others coming down.


1392
01:29:17,212 --> 01:29:30,600
I'm going to have a prayer for everybody after the word.


1393
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:36,624
And I want you to come if there's others who are struggling.


1394
01:29:36,624 --> 01:29:38,125
This is your moment.


1395
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:39,266
This is your time.


1396
01:29:39,266 --> 01:29:45,211
You've held on to it too long.


1397
01:29:45,211 --> 01:29:47,934
Time to let it go.


1398
01:29:47,934 --> 01:29:48,194
Let it go.


1399
01:30:07,117 --> 01:30:13,061
I come, I come.


1400
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,126
Let me pray for those that are down here.


1401
01:30:19,126 --> 01:30:20,987
When I look at those that are here


1402
01:30:20,987 --> 01:30:22,228
there's a lot of pain that's here.


1403
01:30:23,709 --> 01:30:25,730
There's a lot of uncertainty.


1404
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:27,010
But I want to tell you this morning


1405
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:28,971
there's a Savior that can heal.


1406
01:30:28,971 --> 01:30:31,553
Let the healing process begin today.


1407
01:30:31,553 --> 01:30:35,074
It might not be instantaneous


1408
01:30:35,074 --> 01:30:36,195
but you took the first step.


1409
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:37,496
Let me pray.


1410
01:30:37,496 --> 01:30:38,976
Father, I pray for every man


1411
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,057
and woman that's before me.


1412
01:30:41,501 --> 01:30:43,742
God, you know their hearts and you know what they've been through.


1413
01:30:43,742 --> 01:30:45,382
You know the healing that they need.


1414
01:30:45,382 --> 01:30:50,983
And I pray tonight that you would give them the supernatural strength


1415
01:30:52,244 --> 01:30:59,426
to go to bed for the first time in years not angry with that issue gone.


1416
01:30:59,426 --> 01:31:02,726
Because you told us from our hearts to forgive.


1417
01:31:02,726 --> 01:31:04,987
You know the issues, pain.


1418
01:31:04,987 --> 01:31:05,847
Bless those.


1419
01:31:05,847 --> 01:31:06,427
Guide those.


1420
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:07,608
Give them your strength.


1421
01:31:07,608 --> 01:31:08,988
I pray for each and every one.


1422
01:31:09,999 --> 01:31:11,759
In Jesus' name I pray.


1423
01:31:11,759 --> 01:31:13,960
Amen, amen, and amen.


1424
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,800
Amen, Pastor.


1425
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:16,320
You know what?


1426
01:31:17,621 --> 01:31:21,342
That hymn is so beautiful, isn't it?


1427
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:22,122
Just as I am.


1428
01:31:22,122 --> 01:31:23,222
Did you hear those words?


1429
01:31:23,222 --> 01:31:24,522
Go to the first verse.


1430
01:31:24,522 --> 01:31:27,623
Let's close the meeting by singing that hymn.


1431
01:31:27,623 --> 01:31:28,263
Listen.


1432
01:31:28,263 --> 01:31:32,904
As I am, without one plea, no excuses.


1433
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,005
I've been wrong


1434
01:31:34,005 --> 01:31:36,720
but that thy blood was shed for me.


1435
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,881
That's my only hope


1436
01:31:37,881 --> 01:31:39,183
is what you can do for me


1437
01:31:39,183 --> 01:31:41,365
not what I can do for you.


1438
01:31:41,365 --> 01:31:44,569
Let's sing it in closing, shall we?


1439
01:31:44,569 --> 01:31:44,910
Amen?


1440
01:31:54,621 --> 01:31:55,182
Here we go, sing.


1441
01:31:56,797 --> 01:32:08,366
Just as I am without one plea


1442
01:32:08,366 --> 01:32:12,550
but that Thy blood


1443
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:17,814
it was shed on me


1444
01:32:19,515 --> 01:32:31,468
and that Thy I come to thee


1445
01:32:31,468 --> 01:32:43,655
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


1446
01:32:44,655 --> 01:32:46,597
Lord, we ask for all of us


1447
01:32:46,597 --> 01:32:47,817
especially here in the front


1448
01:32:47,817 --> 01:32:50,159
give us today the spirit of a lamb.


1449
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:55,130
We follow Jesus, who was the Lamb of God.


1450
01:32:55,130 --> 01:33:00,514
Not angry, not yelling, not screaming, not holding on to stuff.


1451
01:33:00,514 --> 01:33:01,855
He even prayed, Lord


1452
01:33:01,855 --> 01:33:04,458
you prayed for those who crucified you.


1453
01:33:04,458 --> 01:33:05,979
We cannot do that.


1454
01:33:05,979 --> 01:33:08,701
You have to give us the grace to do that.


1455
01:33:08,701 --> 01:33:13,625
But we let it go today in Jesus' name.


1456
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:17,388
We're not going to let those tormentors torment us again.


1457
01:33:17,388 --> 01:33:18,929
It's in your hands now, God.


1458
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:21,932
Thank you for everyone who's here.


1459
01:33:21,932 --> 01:33:23,653
Thank you for everything that's happened.


1460
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:28,393
Thank you for Pastor Phillip being here and being such a blessing.


1461
01:33:28,393 --> 01:33:31,956
You've given us a beautiful day, those little babies.


1462
01:33:31,956 --> 01:33:37,780
Just bless the offering now, the fellowship with the 40s, the downstairs with the first timers.


1463
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:39,502
Just give us a beautiful end


1464
01:33:39,502 --> 01:33:41,703
we pray in Jesus' name.


1465
01:33:41,703 --> 01:33:45,566
And everyone said, turn around and hug somebody.


1466
01:33:45,566 --> 01:33:47,908
Give someone a hug and a handshake.


1467
01:33:47,908 --> 01:33:49,930
My choir is going to sing one more time.
