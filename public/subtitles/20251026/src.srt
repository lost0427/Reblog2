To the King of Kings


21
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,959
and the Lord of Lords this morning.


22
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,720
Let our praises rock.


23
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,720
The Bible says if we don't praise him


24
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,959
then the rocks will cry out.


25
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,839

Glorify your name, Lord.


33
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,759
Oh, can I just encourage you to speak your praises out loud this morning?


34
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,199
Let's sing this together.


35
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,439

I said you lift your voices, sing how marvelous Jesus.

00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,800
He took my sin.


42
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:53,279
He took my sin and my son is only to have seen my song singing singing.


43
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,039
Well, as the instruments play


44
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,120
if you have a testimony of your own today of how Jesus loved you


45
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,159

46
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,840
just lift your voice to him.


47
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,800
Just take him.

Oh, thank you, Jesus.


49
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,360
How marvelous, how wonderful is his love.

Should the holding one in place because he's as crashing.

Let the wheat say I have small.


57
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,519
Let the boy say I ever knew


58
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:34,240
Because the What the Boy has done for Let the Weeks I have strong.


59

Let's say give thanks.


62
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:05,519

00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:14,319

Let the poor say I am rich


67
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:02,880
because of what the doing has done for us.


68
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,799
I was distracted thinking


69
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,559
weighed down by whatever and a little bit of a funk.


70
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,799
Do you ever go on a funk?


71
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,799
And a voice said to me, probably my conscience


72
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,160
why don't you give thanks?


73
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
You preach about it.


74
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,599
Why don't you do it?


75
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,440
I just preached a few weeks ago about in everything give


76
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,960
And I said, you know what?


77
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
I don't want to be a hypocrite.


78
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,839
That's true.


79
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,440
So I started to give thanks.


80
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,200
I felt nothing.


81
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,119
But as I started to give thanks


82
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,839
because it had been a few hours since I had given thanks to God for anything


83
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,000
everything began to change in my life.


84
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,279
My heart my mind a peace came.


85
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,839
I was reminded that God is faithful.


86
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,680
So can I tell you something today?


87
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,839
If you're going through pressures


88
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,759
and toils and snares and and you've been distracted


89
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,480
why don't you just give thanks to God today?


90
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,720
You know, some of you owe some of you owe not to the IRS


91
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,720
you owe to God a lot of back thanksgiving, right?


92
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,920
Back praises.


93
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,920
How many owe God all the praise, all the thanksgiving?


94
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,039
So we're gonna sing that.


95
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,319
I like that song.


96
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,160
That's from the scriptures.


97
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,359
Uh and we're gonna sing a little verse.


98
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,160
Uh and if you're here today and say, Pastor

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
I need to do what you did that day.


100
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
I need to just start giving thanks.


101
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,079
But I don't feel like giving thanks.


102
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,599
God doesn't say feel anything


103
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,440
He just says give thanks.


104
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
In everything, give thanks.


105
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,119
See if it won't turn everything around.


106
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,599
Come with your heart, come right to the front, from here, upstairs.


107
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,960
If you're watching online


108

109
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,599
and start to give thanks online?


110
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:02,574
Let's start with the verse, okay?


111
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,374

124
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:47,774
Now lift your hands.

Lift your hands and say that.


126
00:20:52,174 --> 00:20:56,014

The Lord has done for us we may sing that verse again.


133
00:21:35,134 --> 00:21:39,454
Maybe some of you other folks need to come up here and join us.


134
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:41,534
This is the Thanksgiving choir.


135

Amen?


136
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,014

Who sees my brokenness and carries me

00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:19,178
when I feel and we're Jesus beat you


217
00:40:22,218 --> 00:40:25,898
and who tells the storm to rest?


218
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:30,538
I am overwhelmed and cannot speak.


219
00:40:30,538 --> 00:40:41,498
Yes, Jesus it is youars my guilt on his shoulder


220
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:49,018
and who holds my heart in his head


221
00:40:52,138 --> 00:40:54,458
and who takes my thoughts


222
00:40:54,458 --> 00:41:04,218
and hangs them on the arms Jesus Is you


223
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:06,698
Yes, my Jesus


224
00:41:06,698 --> 00:43:05,898
It's always you know Jesus.


225
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:12,458
See it out like it's your prayer.


226
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:34,938
Oh I lift my body all my days I give you all of my rights


227
00:43:34,938 --> 00:45:54,618
and all of my to the two it's only the offering.


228
00:45:55,818 --> 00:45:57,898
We don't take it physically, but oh


229
00:45:57,898 --> 00:45:59,818
do we need for you to give today?


230
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,018
We're working out, by the way


231
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:06,938
we're not only gonna bless one prison in Louisiana,


232
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:11,338
Angola, with a a gift bag for Christmas,


233
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:19,418
with uh deodorant toothbrush, toothpaste, or soap, a pair of socks.


234
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:21,018
We're not only gonna bless that one


235
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:26,058
we might bless another prison that has what, fourteen hundred inmates?


236
00:46:27,658 --> 00:46:30,058
Eighteen hundred inmates.


237
00:46:30,058 --> 00:46:36,938
So we're trying to take monies that we God blesses us with to bless others and go out.


238
00:46:36,938 --> 00:46:40,218
Plus pay the bills, plus make repairs.


239
00:46:40,218 --> 00:46:43,018
Lord, I forgot to mention the offering


240
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:45,018
but you know what we need.


241
00:46:45,018 --> 00:46:48,378
Please, Jesus, remind the people to give.


242
00:46:48,378 --> 00:46:50,458
Those who can give special offerings


243
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:53,418
so those who are not giving systematically


244
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:54,858
would you convict them


245
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:59,898
and encourage them to share their substance with the work of the Lord


246
00:46:59,898 --> 00:47:03,498
since you gave us everything that we have?


247
00:47:03,498 --> 00:47:07,578
Bless this offering as the people leave or as they give online.


248
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:08,698
In Jesus' name.


249
00:47:09,738 --> 00:47:10,218
Amen.


250
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:15,338
When Jesus died two thousand years ago


251
00:47:15,338 --> 00:47:16,938
and then rose from the dead


252
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:21,098
he sent his disciples out with a message to share the good news.


253
00:47:21,098 --> 00:47:22,378
What good news?


254
00:47:22,378 --> 00:47:23,658
Gospel means good news.


255
00:47:24,938 --> 00:47:27,258
The good news that God loves us


256
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:29,498
even though we've sinned


257
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:32,858
that there are things that are wrong called sin according to God


258
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:34,778
which are found in his word.


259
00:47:34,778 --> 00:47:36,458
And we've all sinned.


260
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:39,018
And goes tell them that even though they've sinned


261
00:47:39,018 --> 00:47:43,578
God has made a way to be brought close back to God in fellowship


262
00:47:43,578 --> 00:47:45,818
through the death of his son.


263
00:47:45,818 --> 00:47:51,578
He removes that guilt and that barrier through what he did on the cross, rose again


264
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:55,978
so now we can share fellowship with the Lord


265
00:47:55,978 --> 00:47:57,818
and be part of his family.


266
00:47:57,818 --> 00:47:59,018
That was the good news.


267
00:47:59,018 --> 00:48:01,498
And go to heaven when life is over.


268
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:03,338
And that was part of the message.


269
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,338
Uh this life passes away


270
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:07,258
but eternity is coming.


271
00:48:07,258 --> 00:48:09,258
And everyone's gonna spend by the way


272
00:48:09,258 --> 00:48:11,178
everyone here looking at me


273
00:48:11,178 --> 00:48:13,738
you're all gonna spend eternity somewhere.


274
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:15,658
A billion years from now?


275
00:48:15,658 --> 00:48:16,778
Time will be no more


276
00:48:16,778 --> 00:48:17,978
but let's use time.


277
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,098
A billion years from now


278
00:48:19,098 --> 00:48:20,138
we're all gonna be somewhere.


279
00:48:21,418 --> 00:48:24,378
Permanently with the Lord or away.


280
00:48:24,378 --> 00:48:26,858
Well, when they went out and started to preach


281
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:32,778
they had almost exclusively a Jewish audience because they started in Jerusalem.


282
00:48:32,778 --> 00:48:36,458
All the d all the apostles were Jewish, Jesus was Jewish.


283
00:48:37,738 --> 00:48:40,778
So they preached to the Jewish people.


284
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:47,818
And in fact, the Roman Empire thought at first that Christianity was an offshoot,


285
00:48:47,818 --> 00:48:50,138
some little sect of Judaism.


286
00:48:52,058 --> 00:48:55,418
Uh so because they adhered to the Old Testament scripture


287
00:48:55,418 --> 00:48:58,858
but we're now adding the message of Messiah has come.


288
00:49:00,058 --> 00:49:03,178
So as they went around and preached that


289
00:49:03,178 --> 00:49:07,338
everything was either rejection or acceptance


290
00:49:07,338 --> 00:49:10,378
and the early church was made up of all Jewish people


291
00:49:10,378 --> 00:49:13,658
and then Gentiles started started to come in.


292
00:49:13,658 --> 00:49:15,818
But then the Apostle Paul


293
00:49:15,818 --> 00:49:21,018
and others started to go on missionary trips me.


294
00:49:21,018 --> 00:49:25,578
And the first one of the first missionary trips he took, in fact, his second one


295
00:49:25,578 --> 00:49:33,738
he ended up going to what we call Turkey, they called Asia.


296
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:37,818
If I could have a tissue, please, thank you.


297
00:49:37,818 --> 00:49:42,458
And um thanks so much.


298
00:49:43,498 --> 00:49:49,098
And um it went out further than that.


299
00:49:49,098 --> 00:49:51,178
Paul went to Greece.


300
00:49:51,178 --> 00:49:55,178
Now all these places were part of the Roman Empire.


301
00:49:55,178 --> 00:50:02,298
Jerusalem, Israel, Palestine, every place you go, Turkey, called Asia


302
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:08,858
everything was part of this mammoth empire, the biggest yet to be seen by at that day.


303
00:50:08,858 --> 00:50:13,018
Bigger than the Assyrian Empire, bigger than the Babylonian Empire,


304
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:17,898
bigger than the Greek Empire under Alexander the Great.


305
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:19,818
And here was the Roman Empire


306
00:50:19,818 --> 00:50:22,058
which had replaced all of them.


307
00:50:22,058 --> 00:50:23,738
So when they went anywhere


308
00:50:23,738 --> 00:50:26,858
they went to a Greek-speaking world


309
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:30,218
although someplace they spoke Latin


310
00:50:30,218 --> 00:50:33,658
and they started to spread the gospel.


311
00:50:33,658 --> 00:50:36,938
But now the audience was totally different.


312
00:50:36,938 --> 00:50:38,938
Because now the people are saying, Jesus, who?


313
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:42,778
What a sin.


314
00:50:42,778 --> 00:50:45,258
How do you say immorality is wrong?


315
00:50:45,258 --> 00:50:47,978
When in the Roman Empire in Rome


316
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:52,858
the husbands would have their mistress stay in the house with the wife and the children.


317
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:58,058
To say immorality was wrong, like saying drinking coffee is wrong.


318
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:03,418
And the Greek thought and the Greek philosophy


319
00:51:03,418 --> 00:51:07,098
and Greek values had permeated the Roman Empire.


320
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:09,178
So although it was the Roman Empire


321
00:51:09,178 --> 00:51:12,698
it was very um Grecianized


322
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:14,938
Hellenized is the word.


323
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:18,618
And what meant in Greek culture


324
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:25,578
what meant something was education, philosophy, orators.


325
00:51:25,578 --> 00:51:32,858
Some of the biggest names in the Roman Empire were orators, a few poets, but especially orators.


326
00:51:33,978 --> 00:51:36,618
And if you could speak in front of the Senate


327
00:51:36,618 --> 00:51:38,298
or if you could draw a crowd


328
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:45,658
and use ornate language and use your orat uh your your ability to speak to dazzle the crowd


329
00:51:45,658 --> 00:51:47,178
you were a great person.


330
00:51:47,178 --> 00:51:48,538
Athletes.


331
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,378
Athletes were great.


332
00:51:50,378 --> 00:51:53,578
Because the Greek Olympic Games that they started


333
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:55,738
that was being done in the Roman Empire.


334
00:51:56,778 --> 00:51:57,418
Wealth.


335
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:01,738
If you had a lot of money


336
00:52:01,738 --> 00:52:03,258
you were like in our culture


337
00:52:03,258 --> 00:52:04,538
you were considered special.


338
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,018
Why?


339
00:52:05,018 --> 00:52:06,458
Because he made a lot of money.


340
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:09,338
But what if he's uh uh a horrible person?


341
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:09,978
It doesn't matter


342
00:52:09,978 --> 00:52:11,098
he made a lot of money


343
00:52:11,098 --> 00:52:12,698
so he's great.


344
00:52:12,698 --> 00:52:13,738
Or he's on TV


345
00:52:13,738 --> 00:52:15,658
or she's on in the movies.


346
00:52:17,578 --> 00:52:22,218
So now when the gospel came to that audience


347
00:52:22,218 --> 00:52:24,458
it was a whole different story.


348
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:30,378
The Jews were arguing either he is the Messiah that was promised in the Old Testament


349
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:31,978
or he's not the Messiah.


350
00:52:31,978 --> 00:52:33,418
If he is the Messiah


351
00:52:33,418 --> 00:52:34,698
I'll put my trust in him


352
00:52:34,698 --> 00:52:35,978
and I'll become a Christian.


353
00:52:37,098 --> 00:52:41,258
The Apostle Paul was one of the biggest persecutors of the early church.


354
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:44,458
He started out as a man called Saul of Tarsus


355
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,138
and he persecuted the church


356
00:52:46,138 --> 00:52:48,778
had people thrown in prison, divided families


357
00:52:48,778 --> 00:52:52,618
possibly had deaths uh connected to his name.


358
00:52:52,618 --> 00:52:54,538
But then the Lord appeared to him


359
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,578
and he became a fervent Christian and spokesperson.


360
00:52:57,578 --> 00:53:02,858
And he's the one who went into these Roman Empire places


361
00:53:02,858 --> 00:53:05,658
and he was speaking to people who were idolaters.


362
00:53:05,658 --> 00:53:12,378
That the Greek um the Greek religion brought into the Roman Empire like 10,000 gods.


363
00:53:12,378 --> 00:53:16,298
They had 10,000 gods, they worshiped trees, they worshiped mountains


364
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:21,978
and they had their whole hierarchy of of idols and gods.


365
00:53:23,258 --> 00:53:28,298
So when you started to talk about one God who sent his son into the world, they were going


366
00:53:28,298 --> 00:53:29,578
Are you kidding me?


367
00:53:29,578 --> 00:53:30,538
Is this a joke?


368
00:53:31,578 --> 00:53:32,618
Is this a joke?


369
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:37,498
So the Jewish audience they stumbled at the fact


370
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:39,578
that the the preachers were saying


371
00:53:39,578 --> 00:53:40,858
You missed the Messiah


372
00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:42,218
he came and you you missed him.


373
00:53:43,418 --> 00:53:44,698
He was there in front of you


374
00:53:44,698 --> 00:53:46,298
and you didn't know it.


375
00:53:46,298 --> 00:53:49,258
But to the Greek audience in the Roman Empire


376
00:53:49,258 --> 00:53:52,298
it was a matter of ridicule.


377
00:53:52,298 --> 00:53:55,258
Wait a minute, you gotta be kidding, right?


378
00:53:55,258 --> 00:53:57,498
So you're telling me that the God


379
00:53:57,498 --> 00:53:59,338
the true and only one God


380
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:01,818
sent his son who died on a cross.


381
00:54:01,818 --> 00:54:04,218
He let soldiers crucify him.


382
00:54:04,218 --> 00:54:07,418
And he bled, and they put a crown of thorns.


383
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:10,938
And you're saying that's the half naked on a cross


384
00:54:10,938 --> 00:54:12,858
that's the God you worship?


385
00:54:12,858 --> 00:54:13,578
Come on.


386
00:54:13,578 --> 00:54:15,578
I mean, be real.


387
00:54:15,578 --> 00:54:17,178
And the preachers who went out


388
00:54:17,178 --> 00:54:19,018
the Roman Empire laughed at that.


389
00:54:19,018 --> 00:54:20,938
They were used to orators.


390
00:54:20,938 --> 00:54:22,058
What are you talking about?


391
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,658
This guy was a fisherman.


392
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:27,018
The people who got saved


393
00:54:27,018 --> 00:54:31,098
the the church was overwhelmingly the new converts were slaves


394
00:54:31,098 --> 00:54:33,658
which made up the great bulk of the population


395
00:54:33,658 --> 00:54:37,418
but they were uh they were at the low part of the totem pole.


396
00:54:37,418 --> 00:54:38,058
Slaves.


397
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:39,898
You got a bunch of slaves.


398
00:54:39,898 --> 00:54:41,418
You don't even have buildings.


399
00:54:41,418 --> 00:54:42,618
You don't meet in buildings


400
00:54:42,618 --> 00:54:45,898
you're meeting in homes with a bunch of common people.


401
00:54:45,898 --> 00:54:47,258
Where's the big names?


402
00:54:47,258 --> 00:54:49,018
Where's the people with money?


403
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:50,538
Where's the philosophers?


404
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:54,378
I heard this guy, Saul of Tarsus, Paul the apostle, preached.


405
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:55,818
He ain't nothing.


406
00:54:55,818 --> 00:54:57,898
He's not an orator.


407
00:54:57,898 --> 00:54:59,978
We have real, we have the real thing.


408
00:54:59,978 --> 00:55:01,178
We have philosophy.


409
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:02,698
We have wisdom.


410
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:05,418
Greek uh appreciation of wisdom.


411
00:55:05,418 --> 00:55:09,338
Um got into that Roman Empire, and they just, oh


412
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:10,298
he's a philosopher


413
00:55:10,298 --> 00:55:11,658
he's so wise.


414
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:13,098
What a communicator.


415
00:55:13,098 --> 00:55:15,338
You know the story about that old Greek speaker named


416
00:55:15,338 --> 00:55:16,858
I think it was Herodotus


417
00:55:16,858 --> 00:55:20,058
who learned to speak perfectly by putting pebbles


418
00:55:20,058 --> 00:55:21,578
gravel into his mouth


419
00:55:21,578 --> 00:55:25,418
and he would practice for hours every day with pebbles in his mouth.


420
00:55:25,418 --> 00:55:27,578
So that when you took the pebbles out


421
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:30,378
you can uh he could speak even more clearly


422
00:55:30,378 --> 00:55:31,898
had control of his tongue.


423
00:55:31,898 --> 00:55:34,618
By the way, I learned that from a guy who used to come to our church


424
00:55:34,618 --> 00:55:36,218
who was a radio DJ.


425
00:55:36,218 --> 00:55:37,658
This is many years ago


426
00:55:37,658 --> 00:55:38,458
and he told me


427
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:40,618
before you do a taping or something


428
00:55:40,618 --> 00:55:42,618
take a pencil and uh


429
00:55:42,618 --> 00:55:46,858
and put it in your mouth, Pastor Simba, and you know, there, and talk.


430
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:51,418
Do do Psalm 23, or just talk, with the pencil in your mouth.


431
00:55:51,418 --> 00:55:55,098
Because the tongue is fighting against the pencil, right?


432
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:57,018
To get out, the Lord is my shepherd


433
00:55:57,018 --> 00:55:58,058
I shall not want, right?


434
00:55:58,058 --> 00:55:59,018
With the pencil there.


435
00:55:59,018 --> 00:56:00,698
And when you take the pencil out


436
00:56:00,698 --> 00:56:02,858
your your tongue isn't like heavy


437
00:56:02,858 --> 00:56:04,538
it isn't like sluggish


438
00:56:04,538 --> 00:56:05,578
it's more alert.


439
00:56:05,578 --> 00:56:08,218
I have no idea why I'm telling you this story.


440
00:56:08,218 --> 00:56:11,978
It has nothing to do with anything I'm talking about.


441
00:56:11,978 --> 00:56:14,618
I go down rabbit trails sometimes.


442
00:56:14,618 --> 00:56:20,298
So, anyway, so that was the that was the problem when they spread the gospel,


443
00:56:20,298 --> 00:56:22,138
like today in our culture.


444
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:23,018
Come on.


445
00:56:25,098 --> 00:56:26,138
You're you know


446
00:56:26,138 --> 00:56:30,778
you're you're saying like uh Jesus is all I need.


447
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:34,458
So you're talking about an invisible person who you've never seen


448
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:35,578
he's all you need.


449
00:56:35,578 --> 00:56:36,378
You don't need money


450
00:56:36,378 --> 00:56:37,098
you don't need a house.


451
00:56:37,098 --> 00:56:39,658
Come on, be real, would you please?


452
00:56:39,658 --> 00:56:41,738
That's our culture, right?


453
00:56:41,738 --> 00:56:44,218
We're talking about things why, Pastor


454
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:45,338
I've had people say this.


455
00:56:45,338 --> 00:56:46,538
I visited your church.


456
00:56:46,538 --> 00:56:48,618
The lady next to me was lifting her hands.


457
00:56:48,618 --> 00:56:50,058
You didn't tell anyone to lift their hands.


458
00:56:50,058 --> 00:56:51,418
Why was she lifting her hands?


459
00:56:51,418 --> 00:56:52,618
I don't get that.


460
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,618
And I saw, look, she was crying


461
00:56:54,618 --> 00:56:55,738
but she wasn't sad.


462
00:56:55,738 --> 00:56:57,658
She was happy, but she was crying.


463
00:56:57,658 --> 00:56:58,858
What's going on in there?


464
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,498
How many understand what I'm talking about?


465
00:57:03,498 --> 00:57:04,778
It's like Greek to them.


466
00:57:05,898 --> 00:57:07,578
It's like, what are you talking about?


467
00:57:07,578 --> 00:57:09,018
And this religion, yeah.


468
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:11,338
Oh, so he's gonna come back again and what?


469
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:13,898
We're all gonna go to heaven one day and all of that.


470
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:16,298
Come on, be real, would you please?


471
00:57:16,298 --> 00:57:19,738
The only thing that exists is what you can investigate.


472
00:57:19,738 --> 00:57:23,338
The scientific method controls reality.


473
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:24,538
If you can see it


474
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:27,178
test it with a microscope, even, or whatever


475
00:57:27,178 --> 00:57:28,298
that's what's real.


476
00:57:28,298 --> 00:57:31,818
Don't talk about another world that nobody can see.


477
00:57:33,178 --> 00:57:34,778
That's a joke.


478
00:57:34,778 --> 00:57:38,138
That's how you control people, pie in the sky and the by


479
00:57:38,138 --> 00:57:40,538
and by and all of that.


480
00:57:40,538 --> 00:57:44,058
So that's what the early church met with when they went out.


481
00:57:45,498 --> 00:57:52,218
And Paul went to a city in southern Greece in a place called Achaea


482
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:56,778
and there he went to a city called Corinth and he preached there


483
00:57:56,778 --> 00:57:59,498
he stayed 18 months there


484
00:57:59,498 --> 00:58:01,498
and he founded a church


485
00:58:01,498 --> 00:58:06,618
and then there's two letters that he wrote back to that church


486
00:58:06,618 --> 00:58:09,578
because of problems that have arisen.


487
00:58:09,578 --> 00:58:17,578
So one of the uh things that was uh uh accusations against him and the and the Christians


488
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:20,858
which the church was dealing with, was hey, hey, dude


489
00:58:20,858 --> 00:58:21,818
it's a joke.


490
00:58:21,818 --> 00:58:23,978
What you're talking about is a joke.


491
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:27,818
There's no where's the the the great speakers?


492
00:58:27,818 --> 00:58:29,178
Where's the money?


493
00:58:29,178 --> 00:58:31,338
Where's the the pomp and ceremony?


494
00:58:31,338 --> 00:58:32,698
Where's the PhDs?


495
00:58:32,698 --> 00:58:34,218
We're looking for PhDs here


496
00:58:34,218 --> 00:58:36,698
we're not looking for fishermen and slaves.


497
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:40,858
What kind of low life religion is that?


498
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:42,058
That's what they face


499
00:58:42,058 --> 00:58:44,298
which we still face today.


500
00:58:44,298 --> 00:58:47,978
So Paul is telling them look


501
00:58:47,978 --> 00:58:50,378
when I was with you and I preached


502
00:58:50,378 --> 00:58:52,618
I had a wisdom.


503
00:58:52,618 --> 00:58:54,058
They're making fun of you


504
00:58:54,058 --> 00:58:55,258
but don't you get it?


505
00:58:55,258 --> 00:58:58,378
The wisdom of this world is a joke to God.


506
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:03,098
What people call wise and great


507
00:59:03,098 --> 00:59:04,618
God looks at it and goes


508
00:59:04,618 --> 00:59:06,218
You totally missed it.


509
00:59:07,258 --> 00:59:10,538
And the wisdom that we give is the true wisdom


510
00:59:10,538 --> 00:59:12,378
but they don't get it.


511
00:59:12,378 --> 00:59:14,458
In other words, Christians aren't unwise.


512
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:19,578
Christians are the only wise people on the face of the earth, according to God.


513
00:59:19,578 --> 00:59:26,298
So he picks up this um line of thought


514
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:29,178
and he says this we do ever we do,


515
00:59:29,178 --> 00:59:34,538
however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, i.e. the spiritual,


516
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:39,658
but not the wisdom of this age and hold this up there, please, Joy


517
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:43,258
or of the rulers of this age who are coming to nothing.


518
00:59:43,258 --> 00:59:46,138
Do we not need to just ponder that for a second?


519
00:59:46,138 --> 00:59:47,818
He said, We have a wisdom


520
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:50,378
but it's not the wisdom of this age


521
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:53,258
because this age is passing away.


522
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:58,618
We speak another wisdom, which he says, not of this age


523
00:59:58,618 --> 01:00:01,258
or of the rulers who are coming to nothing.


524
01:00:01,258 --> 01:00:04,058
All the big names and all the big politicians


525
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,778
and all the rulers and all the palaces


526
01:00:06,778 --> 01:00:09,818
and all the UN and all the billionaires


527
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:11,738
and everyone who quote made it


528
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:13,258
they're coming to nothing.


529
01:00:15,686 --> 01:00:18,086
In the end, they will be nothing.


530
01:00:18,086 --> 01:00:22,326
Because when God returns and opens the books


531
01:00:22,326 --> 01:00:25,206
they're going to find out they're the biggest losers


532
01:00:25,206 --> 01:00:27,926
and they were living in an illusory world.


533
01:00:27,926 --> 01:00:32,406
Oh, they thought that the Christians were living in an illusory, make-believe world.


534
01:00:32,406 --> 01:00:36,246
They're going to find out they were living their whole life for stuff that doesn't matter.


535
01:00:36,246 --> 01:00:39,526
And the minute they died, they lost everything.


536
01:00:39,526 --> 01:00:41,526
But we Christians, when we die


537
01:00:41,526 --> 01:00:43,206
we're going home.


538
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:44,966
How many of you are planning to go home?


539
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:47,366
We're going to go home.


540
01:00:47,366 --> 01:00:50,006
So do you get the tension here?


541
01:00:50,006 --> 01:00:52,246
The wisdom of this world and of the rulers.


542
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:53,446
And he adds, hey


543
01:00:53,446 --> 01:00:55,686
they're coming to nothing.


544
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:58,246
I know, but she's the biggest movie star.


545
01:00:58,246 --> 01:00:59,526
Everyone wants to be like her.


546
01:01:00,886 --> 01:01:02,326
She's an influencer.


547
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,806
You people talk, they follow influencers.


548
01:01:04,806 --> 01:01:07,606
Why don't you let God and the Bible influence you?


549
01:01:07,606 --> 01:01:10,566
Can we put our hands together and say amen to that?


550
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:15,046
Rather than some influencer who doesn't even know what life is about.


551
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,326
And that's sad.


552
01:01:16,326 --> 01:01:18,566
People, even Christians who go to churches


553
01:01:18,566 --> 01:01:21,606
are following people who are coming to nothing.


554
01:01:21,606 --> 01:01:22,326
You got it?


555
01:01:22,326 --> 01:01:24,086
They're coming to nothing.


556
01:01:24,086 --> 01:01:25,766
Not me, I didn't say that.


557
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:26,966
God's word says it.


558
01:01:26,966 --> 01:01:27,686
So then.


559
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:32,566
No, we declare God's wisdom.


560
01:01:32,566 --> 01:01:33,526
A mystery.


561
01:01:33,526 --> 01:01:34,566
Who's the mystery?


562
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:35,606
Jesus.


563
01:01:35,606 --> 01:01:37,046
That has been hidden and


564
01:01:37,046 --> 01:01:40,326
that God destined for our glory for time began.


565
01:01:40,326 --> 01:01:43,686
So now he's saying Christians have a wisdom.


566
01:01:43,686 --> 01:01:46,566
But it's a wisdom that's a mystery.


567
01:01:46,566 --> 01:01:48,326
You don't see it on the surface.


568
01:01:48,326 --> 01:01:51,126
It's not in the scientific method world.


569
01:01:51,126 --> 01:01:56,646
In that mystery is Christ, salvation, God's love, redemption.


570
01:01:58,326 --> 01:01:59,126
Heaven.


571
01:02:01,286 --> 01:02:03,046
Becoming a born-again person.


572
01:02:03,046 --> 01:02:05,126
That's a wisdom.


573
01:02:05,126 --> 01:02:06,806
He said, that's the true wisdom.


574
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,646
That's the only wisdom that matters.


575
01:02:08,646 --> 01:02:12,806
Brothers and sisters, never be intimidated by people who seem intellectual.


576
01:02:12,806 --> 01:02:14,086
They ain't all that.


577
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:16,646
Trust me, they ain't all that.


578
01:02:16,646 --> 01:02:18,726
In fact, some of the brightest people


579
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:23,286
it's just amazing how warped their lives are


580
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:24,486
and how they don't have a.


581
01:02:24,486 --> 01:02:25,526
I was who is that?


582
01:02:25,526 --> 01:02:28,726
The the was a Supreme Court Justice


583
01:02:28,726 --> 01:02:34,246
or someone recently was coming in as the Secretary of Health and whatever.


584
01:02:34,246 --> 01:02:36,166
And one of the questions they were asked is


585
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,366
could you define a woman?


586
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:41,046
They couldn't define what a woman


587
01:02:41,046 --> 01:02:42,326
but they're really smart.


588
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:44,326
PhD.


589
01:02:45,446 --> 01:02:47,206
They're gonna help rule our country.


590
01:02:47,206 --> 01:02:51,526
They can't say what a woman like a man, like a woman,


591
01:02:51,526 --> 01:02:53,526
because of all the other stuff, right?


592
01:02:53,526 --> 01:02:57,126
So thinking they're wise, they become foolish.


593
01:02:57,126 --> 01:03:04,246
So he goes on and says none of the rulers of this age understood it


594
01:03:04,246 --> 01:03:06,326
, that wisdom, Jesus.


595
01:03:06,326 --> 01:03:07,606
For if they had


596
01:03:07,606 --> 01:03:10,566
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.


597
01:03:10,566 --> 01:03:15,846
All these bright people in the Jewish religion with their high IQs and their religious training.


598
01:03:15,846 --> 01:03:18,566
And you can add the Gentile were with all their learning


599
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:21,206
and their Greek philosophy and their letters


600
01:03:21,206 --> 01:03:23,286
and arts and all that they know.


601
01:03:23,286 --> 01:03:25,206
They're not, they didn't even have a clue.


602
01:03:25,206 --> 01:03:27,286
When God's own Son came


603
01:03:27,286 --> 01:03:28,486
he was right in front of them.


604
01:03:28,486 --> 01:03:29,926
They didn't even get it.


605
01:03:29,926 --> 01:03:32,166
So how smart could you be?


606
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:34,806
God Himself was standing in front of you


607
01:03:34,806 --> 01:03:36,326
the creator of the universe


608
01:03:36,326 --> 01:03:37,366
and you didn't pick it up


609
01:03:37,366 --> 01:03:39,046
but you're really bright.


610
01:03:39,046 --> 01:03:40,886
You're really smart.


611
01:03:40,886 --> 01:03:44,406
So Paul now is encouraging the believers here


612
01:03:44,406 --> 01:03:46,486
that there's a secret wisdom


613
01:03:46,486 --> 01:03:51,926
a spiritual wisdom that's that no one got it,


614
01:03:51,926 --> 01:03:56,246
no one in the world without the help of the Holy Spirit can get it.


615
01:03:56,246 --> 01:04:00,406
And this is the import that I want to leave you with you of this passage.


616
01:04:00,406 --> 01:04:01,926
He said they didn't get it.


617
01:04:01,926 --> 01:04:04,246
Had they really had any real wisdom


618
01:04:04,246 --> 01:04:07,286
they would have known this is God.


619
01:04:07,286 --> 01:04:08,486
Or how about this one?


620
01:04:08,486 --> 01:04:09,526
I'm gonna die one day.


621
01:04:09,526 --> 01:04:12,646
Wouldn't you think it'd be wise for me to prepare to die?


622
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:16,646
No, no, I'm gonna act like I live forever.


623
01:04:16,646 --> 01:04:21,126
There's some now billionaire guy who says he's getting treatments now


624
01:04:21,126 --> 01:04:23,446
and living in a cocoon of somehow


625
01:04:23,446 --> 01:04:26,966
and he's guaranteed he's gonna live 180 years.


626
01:04:26,966 --> 01:04:28,886
No, I just read about him.


627
01:04:28,886 --> 01:04:30,246
He looks weird, by the way.


628
01:04:30,246 --> 01:04:32,326
Very strange looking guy.


629
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,326
And he's gonna live 180 years.


630
01:04:34,326 --> 01:04:35,526
So what if he does?


631
01:04:36,566 --> 01:04:37,686
So then you die.


632
01:04:39,206 --> 01:04:40,086
So then what?


633
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:41,526
No, I don't want to think about that.


634
01:04:41,526 --> 01:04:43,206
Well, how intelligent is that?


635
01:04:43,206 --> 01:04:46,086
How smart is it to make believe you're never gonna die?


636
01:04:47,766 --> 01:04:51,046
But that's commonplace among the intelligentsia.


637
01:04:51,046 --> 01:04:55,206
Don't bring up death or taxes, don't talk about those two things.


638
01:04:55,206 --> 01:04:58,486
So now Paul finishes his thought by saying this.


639
01:04:58,486 --> 01:05:03,606
However, and now he's quoting from Isaiah 64, verse 4 However


640
01:05:03,606 --> 01:05:05,366
as it is written


641
01:05:05,366 --> 01:05:08,006
what no eye has seen


642
01:05:08,006 --> 01:05:10,486
what no ear has heard


643
01:05:10,486 --> 01:05:14,886
and what no human mind has ever conceived


644
01:05:14,886 --> 01:05:18,886
the things God has prepared for those who love him.


645
01:05:20,486 --> 01:05:25,046
These are the things God has revealed to us by his spirit.


646
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:29,766
The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.


647
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:30,806
Oh, go back.


648
01:05:30,806 --> 01:05:31,766
Verse 9.


649
01:05:31,766 --> 01:05:32,406
Go back.


650
01:05:33,446 --> 01:05:36,486
However, as it is written from the Old Testament


651
01:05:36,486 --> 01:05:38,326
what no eye has seen


652
01:05:38,326 --> 01:05:40,726
no scientific method can touch it.


653
01:05:40,726 --> 01:05:43,366
Are you really educated today?


654
01:05:43,366 --> 01:05:46,246
You won't get a clue by using your brain.


655
01:05:47,366 --> 01:05:49,206
You can go to the library and study


656
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:50,486
you'll never get it.


657
01:05:50,486 --> 01:05:51,686
You can be very rich


658
01:05:51,686 --> 01:05:52,566
you'll never get it.


659
01:05:52,566 --> 01:05:53,606
You can be very poor


660
01:05:53,606 --> 01:05:55,046
you'll never get it.


661
01:05:56,166 --> 01:05:57,446
No eye has seen


662
01:05:57,446 --> 01:05:58,966
no ear has heard.


663
01:06:00,006 --> 01:06:02,886
What no human mind has ever conceived


664
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:07,526
the things of God are not privy to the human mind.


665
01:06:07,526 --> 01:06:09,366
Unassisted.


666
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:12,406
But the things that God has prepared


667
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:13,606
uh when I was a kid


668
01:06:13,606 --> 01:06:17,126
I thought that always meant God has prepared for those who love him,


669
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:19,366
meaning heaven and the things of heaven.


670
01:06:19,366 --> 01:06:20,646
But that's not what it means.


671
01:06:20,646 --> 01:06:22,566
Listen, go on.


672
01:06:22,566 --> 01:06:28,086
These are the things God has revealed to us by his spirit.


673
01:06:29,926 --> 01:06:32,326
The spirit, a very mysterious verse.


674
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:37,126
The spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.


675
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:41,606
Everything pertaining to God that will change your life and my life,


676
01:06:41,606 --> 01:06:46,406
not just salvation, but growth in God, being used by God.


677
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:50,566
It can only be revealed by the Holy Spirit.


678
01:06:50,566 --> 01:06:57,286
There is, that's called revelation, revealed to the inner person by the Holy Spirit.


679
01:06:57,286 --> 01:07:00,886
It's called revelation, revealed by the Holy Spirit.


680
01:07:00,886 --> 01:07:02,886
Who's the Holy Spirit?


681
01:07:02,886 --> 01:07:06,566
He, not it, he is the one who Jesus sent


682
01:07:06,566 --> 01:07:10,486
after he accomplished his mission and went back to heaven.


683
01:07:10,486 --> 01:07:14,726
He said, I'm sending you another helper to replace me.


684
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:17,606
He'll be more effective than me in certain ways.


685
01:07:17,606 --> 01:07:19,206
I'm limited to one body


686
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:21,606
he'll be everywhere.


687
01:07:21,606 --> 01:07:23,366
I've been alongside you


688
01:07:23,366 --> 01:07:26,006
he'll live inside of you.


689
01:07:26,006 --> 01:07:27,206
I taught you things


690
01:07:27,206 --> 01:07:28,406
but you didn't get it.


691
01:07:28,406 --> 01:07:29,446
Just to the very end


692
01:07:29,446 --> 01:07:31,606
you were arguing who was the greatest.


693
01:07:31,606 --> 01:07:35,126
But he's going to transform you from the inside out.


694
01:07:35,126 --> 01:07:36,486
Without the Holy Spirit


695
01:07:36,486 --> 01:07:38,166
there's no conviction of sin.


696
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,886
Every one of these new members who said they're a believer


697
01:07:40,886 --> 01:07:41,846
they're only a believer


698
01:07:41,846 --> 01:07:42,806
because of the ministry of the
