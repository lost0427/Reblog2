because of what the Lord has done for me.


74
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:19,039
Just in the last forty-eight hours I was distracted thinking weighed down by whatever


75
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,559
and a little bit of a funk.


76
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,799
Do you ever go in a funk?


77
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,799
And a voice said to me, probably my conscience


78
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,160
why don't you give thanks?


79
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
You preach about it.


80
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,599
Why don't you do it?


81
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,440
We just preached a few weeks ago about in everything give.


82
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,960
And I said, you know what?


83
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,319
I don't want to be a hypocrite.


84
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,839
That's true.


85
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,440
So I started to give thanks.


86
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,200
I felt nothing.


87
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,119
But as I started to give thanks


88
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,839
because it had been a few hours since I had given thanks to God for anything


89
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,039
everything began to change in my life.


90
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,279
My heart my mind a peace came.


91
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,839
I was reminded that God is faithful.


92
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,599
So can I tell you something today?


93
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,759
If you're going through pressures


94
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,759
and toils and snares and and you've been distracted


95
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,480
why don't you just give thanks to God today?


96
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,720
You know, some of you owe some of you owe not to the IRS


97
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,720
you owe to God a lot of back thanksgiving, right?


98
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,920
Back praises.


99
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,920
How many owe God all the praise, all the thanksgiving?


100
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,039
So we're gonna sing that.


101
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,240
I like that song.


102
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,160

103
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,359
Uh and we're gonna sing with the verse.


104
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,160

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
I need to do what you did that day.


106
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,240
I need to just start giving thanks.


107
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,079
But I don't feel like giving thanks.


108
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,599
God doesn't say feel anything.


109
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,440
He just says give thanks.


110
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
In everything, give thanks.


111
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,039
See if it won't turn everything around.


112
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,599
Come with your heart, come right to the front, from here upstairs.

115
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,599
and start to give thanks online?


116
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:02,476
Let's start with the verse, okay?


117
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:15,436

186
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:17,756
Oh I tried to do him my way and nothing to a change.


187
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:22,956
Then he came his saving grace


188
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:27,756
and took my sins away The joy


189
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:39,436

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,720
and carries me when I am fairly weak?


218
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:25,880
Yes, Jesus and who tells the storm to rest?


219
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,520
I am overwhelmed and cannot speak.


220
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:41,560
Yes, Jesus it is youars my guilt on his shoulder


221
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,000
and who holds my heart in his head


222
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,520
and who takes my thoughts


223
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,880
and fears and hangs them on the arms of me.


224
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,680
Jesus is you, yes, my Jesus.


225
00:41:06,680 --> 00:42:58,520
It's always you know, yes.


226
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,440
See it, I'll make it your prayer.


227
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:30,600
Oh, I lift my days


228
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:41,320
I give you all of my rights, and all of my wrong all to Jesus


229
00:43:42,360 --> 00:45:01,480
I often here is you know


230
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:54,600
it's only the offering.


231
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,880
We don't take it physically, but oh


232
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,960
do we need for you to give today?


233
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,000
We're working out, by the way


234
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,920
we're not only gonna bless one prison in Louisiana,


235
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,320
Angola, with a a gift bag for Christmas,


236
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:19,400
with uh deodorant toothbrush, toothpaste, or soap, a pair of socks.


237
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,000
We're not only gonna bless that one


238
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,040
we might bless another prison that has what, four, hundred inmates?


239
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,120
Eighteen hundred inmates.


240
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,640
So we're trying to take monies that we God blesses us with to bless others


241
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,200
and go out, plus pay the bills, plus make repairs.


242
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,000
Lord, I forgot to mention the offering


243
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
but you know what we need.


244
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,360
Please, Jesus, remind the people to give.


245
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,440
Those who can give special offerings


246
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,400
so those who are not giving systematically


247
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,840
would you convict them


248
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,880
and encourage them to share their substance with the work of the Lord


249
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,480
since you gave us everything we have?


250
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,560
Bless this offering as the people leave or as they give online.


251
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,600
In Jesus' name.


252
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,200
Amen.


253
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,320
When Jesus died two thousand years ago


254
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,920
and then rose from the dead


255
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,080
he sent his disciples out with a message to share the good news.


256
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,360
What good news?


257
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,640
Gospel means good news.


258
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,240
The good news that God loves us


259
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,560
even though we've sinned.


260
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,840
That there are things that are wrong called sin according to God


261
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,760
which are found in his word.


262
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,440
And we've all sinned.


263
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,000
And goes tell them that even though they've sinned


264
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,560
God has made a way to be brought close back to God in fellowship


265
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,800
through the death of his son.


266
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,560
He removes that guilt and that barrier through what he did on the cross, rose again


267
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,960
so now we can share fellowship with the Lord


268
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,800
and be part of his family.


269
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,000
That was the good news.


270
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,480
And go to heaven when life is over.


271
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,320
And that was part of the message.


272
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,320
Uh this life passes away


273
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,240
but eternity is coming.


274
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,240
And everyone's gonna spend by the way


275
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,160
everyone here looking at me


276
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,800
you're all gonna spend eternity somewhere.


277
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,640
A billion years from now?


278
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,760
Time will be no more


279
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,960
but let's use time.


280
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,080
A billion years from now


281
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,120
we're all gonna be somewhere.


282
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,360
Permanently with the Lord or away.


283
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,840
Well, when they went out and started to preach


284
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,760
they had almost exclusively a Jewish audience because they started in Jerusalem.


285
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,360
All the all the apostles were Jewish, Jesus was Jewish


286
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,760
so they preached to the Jewish people.


287
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,800
And in fact, the Roman Empire thought at first that Christianity was an offshoot,


288
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,120
some little sect of Judaism.


289
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,400
Uh so because they adhered to the Old Testament scripture


290
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,840
but we're now adding the message of Messiah has come.


291
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,160
So as they went around and preached that


292
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,320
everything was either rejection or acceptance


293
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,360
and the early church was made up of all Jewish people


294
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,640
and then Gentiles started started to come in.


295
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,800
But then the Apostle Paul


296
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,160
and others started to go on missionary trips.


297
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,000
Excuse me.


298
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,560
And the first one of the first missionary trips he took, in fact, his second one


299
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:33,720
he ended up going to what we call Turkey, they called Asia.


300
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,800
If I could have a tissue, please, thank you.


301
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,440
And um thanks so much.


302
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,080
And um it went out further than that.


303
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,160
Paul went to Greece.


304
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,160
Now all these places were part of the Roman Empire.


305
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:02,280
Jerusalem, Israel, Palestine, every place you go, Turkey, called Asia


306
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:08,840
everything was part of this mammoth empire, the biggest yet to be seen by at that day.


307
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,000
Bigger than the Assyrian Empire, bigger than the Babylonian Empire,


308
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,880
bigger than the Greek Empire under Alexander the Great.


309
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,800
And here was the Roman Empire


310
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,040
which had replaced all of them.


311
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,720
So when they went anywhere


312
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,840
they went to a Greek-speaking world


313
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,200
although someplace they spoke Latin


314
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,640
and they started to spread the gospel.


315
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,920
But now the audience was totally different.


316
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,920
Because now the people are saying, Jesus, who?


317
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,720
What sin?


318
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,240
How do you say immorality is wrong?


319
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,120
When in the Roman Empire in Rome


320
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:52,840
husbands would have their mistress stay in the house with the wife and the children.


321
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,040
To say immorality was wrong, like saying drinking coffee is wrong.


322
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,400
And the Greek thought and the Greek philosophy


323
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,080
and Greek values had permeated the Roman Empire.


324
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,160
So although it was the Roman Empire


325
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,680
it was very um Grecianized


326
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,920
Hellenized is the word.


327
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,600
And what meant in Greek culture


328
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:25,560
what meant something was education, philosophy, orators.


329
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:32,840
Some of the biggest names in the Roman Empire were orators, a few poets, but especially orators.


330
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,600
And if you could speak in front of the Senate


331
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,280
or if you could draw a crowd


332
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:45,640
and use ornate language and use your orat uh your your ability to speak to dazzle the crowd


333
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,160
you were a great person.


334
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,520
Athletes.


335
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,360
Athletes were great.


336
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,560
Because the Greek Olympic Games that they started


337
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,720
that was being done in the Roman Empire.


338
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,400
Wealth.


339
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,720
If you had a lot of money


340
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,240
you were like in our culture


341
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,520
you were considered special.


342
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,000
Why?


343
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,440
Because he made a lot of money.


344
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,320
But what if he's uh uh a horrible person?


345
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:09,960
It doesn't matter


346
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,080
he made a lot of money


347
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,680
so he's great.


348
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,720
Or he's on TV


349
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,640
or she's on in the movies.


350
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,200
So now when the gospel came to that audience


351
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,440
it was a whole different story.


352
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:30,360
The Jews were arguing either he is the Messiah that was promised in the Old Testament


353
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,960
or he's not the Messiah.


354
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,400
If he is the Messiah


355
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,680
I'll put my trust in him


356
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,960
and I'll become a Christian.


357
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,240
The Apostle Paul was one of the biggest persecutors of the early church.


358
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,440
He started out as a man called Saul of Tarsus


359
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,120
and he persecuted the church


360
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,760
had people thrown in prison, divided families


361
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,600
possibly had deaths uh connected to his name.


362
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,520
But then the Lord appeared to him


363
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,560
and he became a fervent Christian and spokesperson.


364
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:02,840
And he's the one who went into these Roman Empire places


365
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,640
and he was speaking to people who were idolaters.


366
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:12,360
That the Greek um the Greek religion brought into the Roman Empire like 10,000 gods.


367
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:16,280
They had 10,000 gods, they worshiped trees, they worshiped mountains


368
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,960
and they had their whole hierarchy of of idols and gods.


369
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,280
So when you started to talk about one God who sent his son into the world, they were going


370
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,560
are you kidding me?


371
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,520
Is this a joke?


372
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,520
Is this a joke?


373
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,480
So the Jewish audience they stumbled at the fact


374
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,560
that the the preachers were saying


375
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,840
You missed the Messiah


376
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,280
he came and you you missed him.


377
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,680
He was there in front of you


378
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,280
and you didn't know it.


379
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,240
But to the Greek audience in the Roman Empire


380
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,280
it was a matter of ridicule.


381
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,240
Wait a minute, you gotta be kidding, right?


382
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,480
So you're telling me that the God


383
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,320
the true and only one God


384
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,800
sent his son who died on a cross.


385
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,200
He let soldiers crucify him.


386
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,400
And he bled, and they put a crown of thorns.


387
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,920
And you're saying that's the half naked on a cross


388
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,840
that's the God you worship?


389
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,560
Come on.


390
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,560
I mean, be real.


391
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,160
And the preachers who went out


392
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,000
the Roman Empire laughed at that.


393
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,920
They were used to orators.


394
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,040
What are you talking about?


395
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,640
This guy was a fisherman.


396
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,000
The people who got saved


397
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,080
the church was overwhelmingly the new converts were slaves


398
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,640
which made up the great bulk of the population


399
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,400
but they were uh they were at the low part of the totem pole.


400
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,040
Slaves.


401
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,880
You got a bunch of slaves.


402
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,400
You don't even have buildings.


403
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,600
You don't meet in buildings


404
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,880
you're meeting in homes with a bunch of common people.


405
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,240
Where's the big names?


406
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,000
Where's the people with money?


407
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,520
Where's the philosophers?


408
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,360
I heard this guy, Saul of Tarsus, Paul the apostle, preached.


409
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,800
He ain't nothing.


410
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,880
He's not an orator.


411
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,960
We have real, we have the real thing.


412
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,160
We have philosophy.


413
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,680
We have wisdom.


414
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,400
Greek uh appreciation of wisdom.


415
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,320
Um got into that Roman Empire, and they just, oh


416
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,280
he's a philosopher


417
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,640
he's so wise.


418
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,080
What a communicator.


419
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,320
You know the story about that old Greek speaker named


420
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,840
I think it was Herodotus


421
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,040
who learned to speak perfectly by putting pebbles


422
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,560
gravel into his mouth


423
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,400
and he would practice for hours every day with pebbles in his mouth.


424
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,560
So that when you took the pebbles out


425
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,360
you can uh he could speak even more clearly


426
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,880
had control of his tongue.


427
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,600
By the way, I learned that from a guy who used to come to our church


428
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,200
who was a radio DJ.


429
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,640
This is many years ago


430
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,440
and he told me


431
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,600
before you do a taping or something


432
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,600
take a pencil and uh


433
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,840
and put it in your mouth, Pastor Simba, and you know, there, and talk.


434
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:51,400
Do do Psalm 23, or just talk, with the pencil in your mouth.


435
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,080
Because the tongue is fighting against the pencil, right?


436
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,000
To get out, the Lord is my shepherd


437
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,040
I shall not want, right?


438
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,000
With the pencil there.


439
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,680
And when you take the pencil out


440
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,840
your your tongue isn't like heavy


441
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,520
it isn't like sluggish


442
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,560
it's more alert.


443
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,200
I have no idea why I'm telling you this story.


444
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,960
It has nothing to do with anything I'm talking about.


445
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,600
I go down rabbit trails sometimes.


446
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,400
So, anyway, so that was the


447
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,120
that was the problem when they spread the gospel, like today in our culture.


448
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,000
Come on.


449
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,120
You're you know


450
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,760
you're you're saying like uh Jesus is all I need.


451
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,440
So you're talking about an invisible person who you've never seen


452
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,560
he's all you need.


453
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,360
You don't need money


454
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,080
you don't need a house.


455
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,640
Come on, be real, would you please?


456
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,720
That's our culture, right?


457
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,200
We're talking about things why, Pastor


458
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,320
I've had people say this.


459
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,520
I visited your church.


460
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,600
The lady next to me was lifting her hands.


461
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,040
You didn't tell anyone to lift their hands.


462
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,400
Why was she lifting her hands?


463
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,600
I don't get that.


464
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,600
And I saw, look, she was crying


465
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,720
but she wasn't sad.


466
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,640
She was happy, but she was crying.


467
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,840
What's going on in there?


468
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,480
How many understand what I'm talking about?


469
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,760
It's like Greek to them.


470
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,560
It's like, what are you talking about?


471
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,000
And this religion, yeah.


472
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,320
Oh, so he's gonna come back again and what?


473
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,880
We're all gonna go to heaven one day and all of that.


474
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,280
Come on, be real, would you please?


475
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,720
The only thing that exists is what you can investigate.


476
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,320
The scientific method controls reality.


477
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,520
If you can see it


478
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,160
test it with a microscope, even, or whatever


479
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,280
that's what's real.


480
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,800
Don't talk about another world that nobody can see.


481
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,760
That's a joke.


482
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,400
That's how you control people, pie in the sky


483
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,520
and the buy-and-by, and all of that.


484
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,040
So that's what the early church met with when they went out.


485
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:52,200
And Paul went to a city in southern Greece in a place called Achaea


486
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,400
and there he went to a city called Corinth


487
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,760
and he preached there


488
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,480
he stayed 18 months there


489
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,480
and he founded a church


490
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,600
and then there's two letters that he wrote back to that church


491
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,560
because of problems that have arisen.


492
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:17,560
So one of the uh things that was uh uh accusations against him and the and the Christians


493
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,840
which the church was dealing with, was hey, hey, dude


494
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,800
it's a joke.


495
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,960
What you're talking about is a joke.


496
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,800
There's no where's the the the great speakers?


497
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,160
Where's the money?


498
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,320
Where's the the pomp and ceremony?


499
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,680
Where's the PhDs?


500
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,200
We're looking for PhDs here


501
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,600
we're not looking for fishermen and slaves.


502
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,840
What kind of low life religion is that?


503
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,040
That's what they face


504
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,360
which we still face today.


505
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,960
So Paul is telling them look


506
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,360
when I was with you and I preached


507
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,600
I had a wisdom.


508
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,040
They're making fun of you


509
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,240
but don't you get it?


510
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,360
The wisdom of this world is a joke to God.


511
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,080
What people call wise and great


512
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,680
God looks at it and goes


513
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,120
You totally missed it.


514
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,520
And the wisdom that we give is the true wisdom


515
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,360
but they don't get it.


516
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,440
In other words, Christians aren't unwise.


517
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,560
Christians are the only wise people on the face of the earth, according to God.


518
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:26,280
So he picks up this um line of thought


519
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,160
and he says this we do ever we do,


520
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,760
however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature,


521
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,600
i.e. the spiritual, but not the wisdom of this age.


522
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,640
And hold this up there, please, Joy


523
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,240
or of the rulers of this age who are coming to nothing.


524
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,120
Do we not need to just ponder that for a second?


525
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,800
He said, We have a wisdom


526
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,360
but it's not the wisdom of this age


527
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,240
because this age is passing away.


528
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:58,600
We speak another wisdom, which he says, not of this age


529
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,240
or of the rulers who are coming to nothing.


530
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,040
All the big names and all the big politicians


531
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,760
and all the rulers and all the palaces


532
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,800
and all the UN and all the billionaires


533
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,720
and everyone who quote made it


534
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,240
they're coming to nothing.


535
01:00:15,668 --> 01:00:18,068
In the end, they will be nothing.


536
01:00:18,068 --> 01:00:22,308
Because when God returns and opens the books


537
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:25,188
they're going to find out they're the biggest losers


538
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,908
and they were living in an illusory world.


539
01:00:27,908 --> 01:00:32,388
Oh, they thought that the Christians were living in an illusory, make-believe world.


540
01:00:32,388 --> 01:00:36,228
They're going to find out they were living their whole life for stuff that doesn't matter.


541
01:00:36,228 --> 01:00:39,508
And the minute they died, they lost everything.


542
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:41,508
But we Christians, when we die


543
01:00:41,508 --> 01:00:43,188
we're going home.


544
01:00:43,188 --> 01:00:44,948
How many of you are planning to go home?


545
01:00:44,948 --> 01:00:47,348
We're going to go home.


546
01:00:47,348 --> 01:00:49,988
So do you get that you get the tension here?


547
01:00:49,988 --> 01:00:52,228
The wisdom of this world and of the rulers.


548
01:00:52,228 --> 01:00:53,428
And he adds, hey


549
01:00:53,428 --> 01:00:55,668
they're coming to nothing.


550
01:00:55,668 --> 01:00:58,228
I know, but she's the biggest movie star.


551
01:00:58,228 --> 01:00:59,668
Everyone wants to be like her.


552
01:01:00,868 --> 01:01:02,308
She's an influencer.


553
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:04,788
You teach people talk, they follow influencers.


554
01:01:04,788 --> 01:01:07,588
Why don't you let God and the Bible influence you?


555
01:01:07,588 --> 01:01:10,548
Can we put our hands together and say amen to that?


556
01:01:10,548 --> 01:01:15,028
Rather than some influencer who doesn't even know what life is about.


557
01:01:15,028 --> 01:01:16,308
And that's sad.


558
01:01:16,308 --> 01:01:18,548
People, even Christians who go to churches


559
01:01:18,548 --> 01:01:21,588
are following people who are coming to nothing.


560
01:01:21,588 --> 01:01:22,308
You got it?


561
01:01:22,308 --> 01:01:24,068
They're coming to nothing.


562
01:01:24,068 --> 01:01:25,748
Not me, I didn't say that.


563
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:26,948
God's word says it.


564
01:01:26,948 --> 01:01:27,668
So then.


565
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:32,548
No, we declare God's wisdom.


566
01:01:32,548 --> 01:01:33,508
A mystery.


567
01:01:33,508 --> 01:01:34,548
Who's the mystery?


568
01:01:34,548 --> 01:01:35,588
Jesus.


569
01:01:35,588 --> 01:01:37,028
That has been hidden and


570
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:40,308
that God destined for our glory for time began.


571
01:01:40,308 --> 01:01:43,748
So now he's saying Christians have a wisdom.


572
01:01:43,748 --> 01:01:46,548
But it's a wisdom that's a mystery.


573
01:01:46,548 --> 01:01:48,308
You don't see it on the surface.


574
01:01:48,308 --> 01:01:51,108
It's not in the scientific method world.


575
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:56,628
In that mystery is Christ, salvation, God's love, redemption.


576
01:01:58,308 --> 01:01:59,108
Heaven.


577
01:02:01,268 --> 01:02:03,028
Becoming a born-again person.


578
01:02:03,028 --> 01:02:05,108
That's a wisdom.


579
01:02:05,108 --> 01:02:06,788
He said, that's the true wisdom.


580
01:02:06,788 --> 01:02:08,628
That's the only wisdom that matters.


581
01:02:08,628 --> 01:02:12,868
Brothers and sisters, never be intimidated by people who seem intellectual.


582
01:02:12,868 --> 01:02:14,068
They ain't all that.


583
01:02:15,108 --> 01:02:16,628
Trust me, they ain't all that.


584
01:02:16,628 --> 01:02:19,108
In fact, some of the brightest people


585
01:02:19,108 --> 01:02:23,268
uh it's just amazing how warped their lives are


586
01:02:23,268 --> 01:02:25,508
and how they don't have a I was who was that?


587
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:28,708
The the was a Supreme Court Justice


588
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:34,228
or someone recently was coming in as the Secretary of Health and whatever.


589
01:02:34,228 --> 01:02:36,148
And one of the questions they were asked is


590
01:02:36,148 --> 01:02:37,348
could you define a woman?


591
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:40,948
They couldn't define what a woman


592
01:02:40,948 --> 01:02:42,388
but they're really smart.


593
01:02:43,428 --> 01:02:44,308
PhD.


594
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,188
They're gonna help rule our country.


595
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:51,508
They can't say what a woman like a man, like a woman,


596
01:02:51,508 --> 01:02:53,508
because of all the other stuff, right?


597
01:02:53,508 --> 01:02:57,108
So thinking they're wise, they become foolish.


598
01:02:57,108 --> 01:03:04,228
So he goes on and says none of the rulers of this age understood it,


599
01:03:04,228 --> 01:03:06,388
that wisdom, Jesus.


600
01:03:06,388 --> 01:03:07,588
For if they had


601
01:03:07,588 --> 01:03:10,548
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.


602
01:03:10,548 --> 01:03:15,828
All these bright people in the Jewish religion with their high IQs and their religious training.


603
01:03:15,828 --> 01:03:18,548
And you can add the Gentile were with all their learning


604
01:03:18,548 --> 01:03:21,188
and their Greek philosophy and their letters


605
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:23,268
and arts and all that they know.


606
01:03:23,268 --> 01:03:25,188
They're not, they didn't even have a clue.


607
01:03:25,188 --> 01:03:27,268
When God's own Son came


608
01:03:27,268 --> 01:03:28,468
he was right in front of them.


609
01:03:28,468 --> 01:03:29,908
They didn't even get it.


610
01:03:29,908 --> 01:03:32,148
So how smart could you be?


611
01:03:32,148 --> 01:03:34,788
God Himself was standing in front of you


612
01:03:34,788 --> 01:03:36,308
the creator of the universe


613
01:03:36,308 --> 01:03:37,348
and you didn't pick it up


614
01:03:37,348 --> 01:03:39,028
but you're really bright.


615
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:40,868
You're really smart.


616
01:03:40,868 --> 01:03:44,388
So Paul now is encouraging the believers here


617
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:46,468
that there's a secret wisdom


618
01:03:46,468 --> 01:03:51,988
a spiritual wisdom that's that no one got it,


619
01:03:51,988 --> 01:03:56,228
no one in the world without the help of the Holy Spirit can get it.


620
01:03:56,228 --> 01:04:00,388
And this is the import that I want to leave you with you of this passage.


621
01:04:00,388 --> 01:04:01,908
He said they didn't get it.


622
01:04:01,908 --> 01:04:04,228
Had they really had any real wisdom


623
01:04:04,228 --> 01:04:07,268
they would have known this is God.


624
01:04:07,268 --> 01:04:08,468
Or how about this one?


625
01:04:08,468 --> 01:04:09,588
I'm gonna die one day.


626
01:04:09,588 --> 01:04:12,628
Wouldn't you think it'd be wise for me to prepare to die?


627
01:04:13,748 --> 01:04:16,628
No, no, I'm gonna act like I live forever.


628
01:04:16,628 --> 01:04:21,108
There's some now billionaire guy who says he's getting treatments now


629
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:23,428
and living in a cocoon of somehow


630
01:04:23,428 --> 01:04:26,948
and he's guaranteed he's gonna live 180 years.


631
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:28,868
No, I just read about him.


632
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:30,228
He looks weird, by the way.


633
01:04:30,228 --> 01:04:32,308
Very strange looking guy.


634
01:04:32,308 --> 01:04:34,308
And he's gonna live 180 years.


635
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:35,508
So what if he does?


636
01:04:36,548 --> 01:04:37,668
So then you die.


637
01:04:39,188 --> 01:04:40,068
So then what?


638
01:04:40,068 --> 01:04:41,508
No, I don't want to think about that.


639
01:04:41,508 --> 01:04:43,188
Well, how intelligent is that?


640
01:04:43,188 --> 01:04:46,068
How smart is it to make believe you're never gonna die?


641
01:04:47,748 --> 01:04:51,108
But that's commonplace among the intelligentsia.


642
01:04:51,108 --> 01:04:55,188
Don't bring up death or taxes, don't talk about those two things.


643
01:04:55,188 --> 01:04:58,468
So now Paul finishes his thought by saying this.


644
01:04:58,468 --> 01:05:03,588
However, and now he's quoting from Isaiah 64, verse 4 However


645
01:05:03,588 --> 01:05:05,348
as it is written


646
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:07,988
what no eye has seen


647
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:10,468
what no ear has heard


648
01:05:10,468 --> 01:05:14,868
and what no human mind has ever conceived


649
01:05:14,868 --> 01:05:18,868
the things God has prepared for those who love him.


650
01:05:20,388 --> 01:05:25,028
These are the things God has revealed to us by his spirit.


651
01:05:25,028 --> 01:05:29,748
The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.


652
01:05:29,748 --> 01:05:30,788
Oh, go back.


653
01:05:30,788 --> 01:05:31,748
Verse 9.


654
01:05:31,748 --> 01:05:32,388
Go back.


655
01:05:33,428 --> 01:05:36,468
However, as it is written from the Old Testament


656
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:38,308
what no eye has seen


657
01:05:38,308 --> 01:05:40,708
no scientific method can touch it.


658
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:43,348
Are you really educated today?


659
01:05:43,348 --> 01:05:46,228
You won't get a clue by using your brain.


660
01:05:47,348 --> 01:05:49,188
You can go to the library and study


661
01:05:49,188 --> 01:05:50,468
you'll never get it.


662
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:51,668
You can be very rich


663
01:05:51,668 --> 01:05:52,548
you'll never get it.


664
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:53,588
You can be very poor


665
01:05:53,588 --> 01:05:55,028
you'll never get it.


666
01:05:56,148 --> 01:05:57,428
No eye has seen


667
01:05:57,428 --> 01:05:58,948
no ear has heard.


668
01:05:59,988 --> 01:06:02,868
What no human mind has ever conceived


669
01:06:02,868 --> 01:06:07,508
the things of God are not privy to the human mind.


670
01:06:07,508 --> 01:06:09,348
Unassisted.


671
01:06:09,348 --> 01:06:12,388
But the things that God has prepared, no


672
01:06:12,388 --> 01:06:13,588
uh when I was a kid


673
01:06:13,588 --> 01:06:17,108
I thought that always meant God has prepared for those who love him,


674
01:06:17,108 --> 01:06:19,348
meaning heaven and the things of heaven.


675
01:06:19,348 --> 01:06:20,628
But that's not what it means.


676
01:06:20,628 --> 01:06:22,548
Listen, go on.


677
01:06:22,548 --> 01:06:28,068
These are the things God has revealed to us by his spirit.


678
01:06:29,908 --> 01:06:32,308
The spirit, a very mysterious verse.


679
01:06:32,308 --> 01:06:37,108
The spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.


680
01:06:37,108 --> 01:06:41,588
Everything pertaining to God that will change your life and my life,


681
01:06:41,588 --> 01:06:46,388
not just salvation, but growth in God, being used by God.


682
01:06:46,388 --> 01:06:50,548
It can only be revealed by the Holy Spirit.


683
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:57,268
There is, that's called revelation, revealed to the inner person by the Holy Spirit.


684
01:06:57,268 --> 01:07:00,868
It's called revelation, revealed by the Holy Spirit.


685
01:07:00,868 --> 01:07:02,388
Who's the Holy Spirit?


686
01:07:02,388 --> 01:07:04,228
He, He, not it


687
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:10,468
He is the one who Jesus sent after He accomplished His mission and went back to heaven.


688
01:07:10,468 --> 01:07:14,708
He said, I'm sending you another helper to replace me.


689
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:17,588
He'll be more effective than me in certain ways.


690
01:07:17,588 --> 01:07:19,188
I'm limited to one body


691
01:07:19,188 --> 01:07:21,588
he'll be everywhere.


692
01:07:21,588 --> 01:07:23,348
I've been alongside you


693
01:07:23,348 --> 01:07:25,988
he'll live inside of you.


694
01:07:25,988 --> 01:07:27,188
I taught you things


695
01:07:27,188 --> 01:07:28,388
but you didn't get it.


696
01:07:28,388 --> 01:07:29,428
Just to the very end


697
01:07:29,428 --> 01:07:31,588
you were arguing who was the greatest.


698
01:07:31,588 --> 01:07:35,108
But he's going to transform you from the inside out.


699
01:07:35,108 --> 01:07:36,468
Without the Holy Spirit


700
01:07:36,468 --> 01:07:38,148
there's no conviction of sin.


701
01:07:38,148 --> 01:07:40,868
Every one of these new members who said they're a believer


702
01:07:40,868 --> 01:07:41,988
they're only a believer


703
01:07:41,988 --> 01:07:44,468
because of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.


704
01:07:44,468 --> 01:07:48,468
Nobody can convict another person they're a sinner except the Holy Spirit.


705
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:50,308
You can yell at them, talk to them


706
01:07:50,308 --> 01:07:56,228
give them verses until the Holy Spirit hits their heart and they feel that touch.


707
01:07:56,228 --> 01:07:57,748
There's no conviction of sin.


708
01:07:57,748 --> 01:07:59,668
He's the one convicts of sin.


709
01:07:59,668 --> 01:08:00,708
There's no new birth.


710
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:03,348
You can't be a born-again Christian without the Holy Spirit.


711
01:08:03,348 --> 01:08:04,948
What is a born-again Christian?


712
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:07,748
The Holy Spirit lives inside of you and me.


713
01:08:07,748 --> 01:08:11,428
You can't love other people without the Holy Spirit


714
01:08:11,428 --> 01:08:12,948
because He's the Spirit of love.


715
01:08:12,948 --> 01:08:16,228
Otherwise, you're left with your cultural baggage


716
01:08:16,228 --> 01:08:18,148
and your hate and prejudices


717
01:08:18,148 --> 01:08:21,188
and nationalism and all of that.


718
01:08:21,188 --> 01:08:24,388
Only the Holy Spirit can make Ukraine hug Russia.


719
01:08:26,388 --> 01:08:28,068
Am I right or wrong?


720
01:08:28,068 --> 01:08:28,948
Only that.


721
01:08:31,348 --> 01:08:33,588
He's the one who inspired the Bible.


722
01:08:33,588 --> 01:08:34,708
You can't read the Bible


723
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:37,668
get anything out of it without the Holy Spirit teaching you.


724
01:08:37,668 --> 01:08:38,868
You can sit under me


725
01:08:38,868 --> 01:08:41,348
or any other pastor and you'll just get proud


726
01:08:41,348 --> 01:08:43,188
because you get some knowledge in your head.


727
01:08:43,188 --> 01:08:45,028
But the Holy Spirit makes it real


728
01:08:45,028 --> 01:08:49,988
and humbles us and makes us want to be more like Christ.


729
01:08:49,988 --> 01:08:51,748
He's the spirit of assurance.


730
01:08:51,748 --> 01:08:55,588
He witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.


731
01:08:55,588 --> 01:08:56,708
That's how we know.


732
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:59,028
How many know that you know that you know


733
01:08:59,028 --> 01:09:00,068
wave it at me


734
01:09:00,068 --> 01:09:03,188
that you know that you know that you're a child of God?


735
01:09:03,188 --> 01:09:04,628
Well, how do you know that?


736
01:09:04,628 --> 01:09:06,388
I know it by the Holy Spirit.


737
01:09:06,388 --> 01:09:07,588
Show me the Holy Spirit.


738
01:09:07,588 --> 01:09:10,708
I can't, but that's the ultimate reality.


739
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:14,228
The ultimate reality of this world is not what you see


740
01:09:14,228 --> 01:09:16,868
it's what the Holy Spirit and God is doing.


741
01:09:16,868 --> 01:09:19,588
That's the real thing that's going on here.


742
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:22,228
In heaven, they're not talking about the world series


743
01:09:22,228 --> 01:09:24,468
or the NFL or Russia


744
01:09:24,468 --> 01:09:27,108
and Ukraine and the UN and all that other stuff.


745
01:09:27,108 --> 01:09:28,628
When you think they're discussing that


746
01:09:28,628 --> 01:09:32,948
they're discussing how the spirit is building up the church of Jesus Christ.


747
01:09:32,948 --> 01:09:35,588
Come on, let's say a loud amen here and clap.


748
01:09:38,468 --> 01:09:40,228
He's the spirit of joy.


749
01:09:40,228 --> 01:09:41,348
There's no joy.


750
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:42,868
He takes the things of Christ


751
01:09:42,868 --> 01:09:44,308
and makes it real to us.


752
01:09:44,308 --> 01:09:47,188
Not only makes it real to us so that we know


753
01:09:47,188 --> 01:09:49,508
but he gives us his joy.


754
01:09:49,508 --> 01:09:52,468
The fruit of the spirit is love, joy.


755
01:09:52,468 --> 01:09:53,748
How do you have peace?


756
01:09:53,748 --> 01:09:56,788
Only through the Holy Spirit, not through study.


757
01:09:56,788 --> 01:09:58,068
Study has its place


758
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:59,748
but unless the spirit is working


759
01:09:59,748 --> 01:10:01,428
you ain't got nothing.


760
01:10:01,428 --> 01:10:03,108
There's nothing to be had.


761
01:10:03,108 --> 01:10:04,788
And the world laughs at that


762
01:10:04,788 --> 01:10:06,868
because it can't test the Holy Spirit.


763
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:10,628
You're talking about someone beyond their experience.


764
01:10:10,628 --> 01:10:15,748
The natural man, another place in the Bible, does not receive spiritual things.


765
01:10:15,748 --> 01:10:17,828
They're only spiritually discerned.


766
01:10:17,828 --> 01:10:24,388
So some third grade dropout here who attends our church who's in their 70s


767
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:28,788
or 80s and just was cheated out of a good schooling experience.


768
01:10:28,788 --> 01:10:31,028
They could know more than the theologian


769
01:10:31,028 --> 01:10:33,428
because the Holy Spirit is teaching them.


770
01:10:33,428 --> 01:10:37,988
While the theologian is only using his brain power.


771
01:10:37,988 --> 01:10:43,668
My goodness, people go to seminary and backslide even while they're learning facts about God.


772
01:10:43,668 --> 01:10:49,108
Facts about God can lead you astray unless the Holy Spirit is tenderizing you


773
01:10:49,108 --> 01:10:51,108
and making it real in your heart.


774
01:10:51,108 --> 01:10:55,188
I believe God deserves a big hand clap of praise.


775
01:10:55,188 --> 01:10:57,508
So we're all on equal footing.


776
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:04,148
Notice this revealed to us by his spirit.


777
01:11:04,148 --> 01:11:05,828
Oh, that sounds so spooky.


778
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,148
It's just a fact of spiritual life.


779
01:11:08,148 --> 01:11:09,588
If you don't have revelation


780
01:11:09,588 --> 01:11:11,588
I've met people, some of the brightest people


781
01:11:11,588 --> 01:11:13,188
and with a religious background


782
01:11:13,188 --> 01:11:14,308
they don't have a clue.


783
01:11:14,308 --> 01:11:15,588
And this is another thing.


784
01:11:15,588 --> 01:11:19,108
You'll hear politicians or sometimes people talk about God.


785
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:23,508
They have no concept of the word, let's say, grace.


786
01:11:23,508 --> 01:11:26,068
They think I have to do something to get to heaven


787
01:11:26,068 --> 01:11:27,428
no matter how you tell them


788
01:11:27,428 --> 01:11:28,628
they don't get it.


789
01:11:28,628 --> 01:11:30,468
Cabesa dura.


790
01:11:30,468 --> 01:11:31,508
Hard head.


791
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,868
Do you understand what I'm saying?


792
01:11:34,868 --> 01:11:36,148
But they're the wealthiest


793
01:11:36,148 --> 01:11:37,988
but they don't have a clue.


794
01:11:37,988 --> 01:11:38,868
They don't have a clue.


795
01:11:38,868 --> 01:11:41,348
But I know they have a PhD, two PhDs.


796
01:11:41,348 --> 01:11:44,708
They're ignorant of the things that really matter.


797
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:47,988
The things that really matter only come by the Spirit.


798
01:11:47,988 --> 01:11:50,468
And it's available to anyone.


799
01:11:50,468 --> 01:11:52,228
Oh, praise God.


800
01:11:52,228 --> 01:11:53,508
Aren't you happy with that?


801
01:11:53,508 --> 01:11:55,028
It's available to anyone.


802
01:11:55,028 --> 01:11:56,468
No, I gotta go to Way


803
01:11:56,468 --> 01:11:57,668
I gotta get a Master's


804
01:11:57,668 --> 01:11:59,428
I gotta get an MDiv


805
01:11:59,428 --> 01:12:00,788
I gotta get a PhD.


806
01:12:00,788 --> 01:12:02,548
No, look, however God leads you.


807
01:12:02,548 --> 01:12:05,908
But the main thing is be taught by the Spirit.


808
01:12:05,908 --> 01:12:11,908
Let the Holy Spirit be educating you, discipling you.


809
01:12:13,748 --> 01:12:15,188
Notice this, no, go back.


810
01:12:15,188 --> 01:12:16,308
I'm sorry.


811
01:12:16,308 --> 01:12:22,468
So notice that phrase the spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.


812
01:12:22,468 --> 01:12:24,788
So go to uh what's the next one, 11?


813
01:12:26,628 --> 01:12:32,708
For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them?


814
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:33,988
In the same way


815
01:12:33,988 --> 01:12:38,228
no one knows the thoughts of God except the spirit.


816
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:40,548
Is that not an amazing verse?


817
01:12:40,548 --> 01:12:44,548
What an insult to our intellectual pride.


818
01:12:44,548 --> 01:12:48,708
No one knows the things of me except my spirit.


819
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:52,628
My wife doesn't know me like my spirit knows me.


820
01:12:52,628 --> 01:12:57,828
The real me, the inside me, with all my hopes and fears.


821
01:12:59,348 --> 01:13:01,028
And the same thing with you.


822
01:13:01,028 --> 01:13:03,348
There's your spirit knows you.


823
01:13:03,348 --> 01:13:05,988
And you can try to communicate it to someone else.


824
01:13:05,988 --> 01:13:07,668
But how many get what I'm talking about?


825
01:13:07,668 --> 01:13:08,948
Just say amen.


826
01:13:08,948 --> 01:13:12,548
No one knows the spirit, a person except his spirit.


827
01:13:12,548 --> 01:13:15,828
And he says, that's the way it is with God.


828
01:13:15,828 --> 01:13:20,468
No one knows God except the spirit of God.


829
01:13:20,468 --> 01:13:22,068
And that spirit of God


830
01:13:22,068 --> 01:13:24,948
in a way we don't obviously comprehend


831
01:13:24,948 --> 01:13:29,668
he searches all the deep things of God so


832
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:34,468
that he can communicate it to us so we can know more


833
01:13:34,468 --> 01:13:40,868
and more about God through the Spirit, not through intellectual training.


834
01:13:40,868 --> 01:13:43,908
Look, if only high IQ people


835
01:13:43,908 --> 01:13:50,708
and people very gifted in in education were were qualified to grow


836
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:52,548
it would write off most of the world.


837
01:13:53,588 --> 01:13:55,428
Most of the world can't read.


838
01:13:57,668 --> 01:13:59,348
But through the Holy Spirit


839
01:13:59,348 --> 01:14:01,268
they can become like Christ.


840
01:14:01,268 --> 01:14:04,308
Look, except the Spirit of God.


841
01:14:04,308 --> 01:14:10,868
No one knows those deep things of God, the deep yearnings of God, God's ways,


842
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:12,468
God's personality,


843
01:14:12,468 --> 01:14:13,028
and all that.


844
01:14:13,028 --> 01:14:14,708
You say, No, I read the Bible.


845
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:15,588
I read the Bible.


846
01:14:15,588 --> 01:14:16,308
That's good.


847
01:14:16,308 --> 01:14:18,228
That's a concept about God.


848
01:14:18,228 --> 01:14:19,908
Those are concepts about God.


849
01:14:19,908 --> 01:14:20,868
But that's not God.


850
01:14:20,868 --> 01:14:23,668
God is not ink on a page.


851
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,428
This points us to God so


852
01:14:25,428 --> 01:14:27,268
that we can open up and say


853
01:14:27,268 --> 01:14:30,708
Spirit of the living God, teach me.


854
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:33,428
So that I can know who Jesus really is.


855
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:37,108
In closing, look.


856
01:14:39,108 --> 01:14:43,668
What we have received is not the spirit of the world


857
01:14:43,668 --> 01:14:45,828
but the spirit who is from God.


858
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:47,348
That's what we've received.


859
01:14:47,348 --> 01:14:51,108
We haven't received a worldly spirit like the people in this world.


860
01:14:51,108 --> 01:14:53,188
Education, money, and all of that.


861
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:54,228
I'm somebody.


862
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:55,588
And I'm better than you


863
01:14:55,588 --> 01:14:59,828
and I have more than you, and a social standing and all that nonsense.


864
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,268
We haven't received that spirit.


865
01:15:02,548 --> 01:15:05,988
No, we've received the spirit who is from God, capital S.


866
01:15:07,028 --> 01:15:13,108
So that look, we may understand what God has freely given us.


867
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:16,308
It's not like they taught me when I was young.


868
01:15:16,308 --> 01:15:20,468
I thought it meant the Spirit shows us what's coming in heaven.


869
01:15:20,468 --> 01:15:21,428
No eye is seen


870
01:15:21,428 --> 01:15:22,548
no ear is heard


871
01:15:22,548 --> 01:15:23,748
what's waiting for us


872
01:15:23,748 --> 01:15:25,348
when we cross the river


873
01:15:25,348 --> 01:15:27,428
and go to our heavenly home.


874
01:15:27,428 --> 01:15:28,948
That's probably true too


875
01:15:28,948 --> 01:15:30,708
but notice what it says here.


876
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:32,708
The Spirit was given so


877
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:37,348
that we would know the things that God has for us right here.


878
01:15:37,348 --> 01:15:38,868
Right now.


879
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,788
The Spirit wants to show us that


880
01:15:40,788 --> 01:15:46,548
and teach us that so we can take our position as mature brothers and sisters in Christ.


881
01:15:46,548 --> 01:15:48,388
We can be real Christians


882
01:15:48,388 --> 01:15:49,828
we can overcome the flesh


883
01:15:49,828 --> 01:15:51,268
and the world and the devil.


884
01:15:51,268 --> 01:15:51,908
Why?


885
01:15:51,908 --> 01:15:53,828
Because God has given us that ability.


886
01:15:53,828 --> 01:15:54,708
How do we know that?


887
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:57,348
The Spirit has shown us.


888
01:15:57,348 --> 01:16:00,708
Hasn't the verse ever jumped at you out of the Bible?


889
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:02,068
You read it ten times


890
01:16:02,068 --> 01:16:04,788
but then you read it and you go, Oh my goodness.


891
01:16:04,788 --> 01:16:06,068
Praise God for that.


892
01:16:06,068 --> 01:16:07,908
How come you didn't see it the first time?


893
01:16:07,908 --> 01:16:10,628
Because now the Spirit is teaching you.


894
01:16:10,628 --> 01:16:13,348
Oh, praise God for the Holy Spirit.


895
01:16:14,948 --> 01:16:16,228
Christianity!


896
01:16:17,668 --> 01:16:22,468
Christianity is, oh, the glory of your presence, brother, if you come.


897
01:16:22,468 --> 01:16:25,668
Christianity is hopeless without the Holy Spirit.


898
01:16:27,428 --> 01:16:28,148
Look at me.


899
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:29,268
It's hopeless.


900
01:16:29,268 --> 01:16:31,668
You know what churches are finding now?


901
01:16:31,668 --> 01:16:35,908
I'm so glad what God is doing among the youth and among sanctas.


902
01:16:35,908 --> 01:16:39,748
Here's what pastors are telling me all around the world, uh around the country.


903
01:16:39,748 --> 01:16:41,668
We have the kids when they grow up


904
01:16:41,668 --> 01:16:46,388
the minute they go to high school or college, adios muchacho, they're gone.


905
01:16:46,388 --> 01:16:47,348
Why?


906
01:16:47,348 --> 01:16:48,708
They know about God


907
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:51,508
but they don't know God through the Holy Spirit.


908
01:16:51,508 --> 01:16:53,988
They have no experience with God.


909
01:16:53,988 --> 01:16:56,388
How many believe today you can experience God?


910
01:16:56,388 --> 01:16:57,108
He's a living


911
01:16:57,108 --> 01:16:58,068
wave your hand at me.


912
01:16:58,068 --> 01:16:59,028
He's a living God.


913
01:16:59,028 --> 01:17:00,868
We just don't just study about him.


914
01:17:00,868 --> 01:17:02,228
He's not a concept.


915
01:17:02,228 --> 01:17:05,748
God is not a concept, he's alive.


916
01:17:05,748 --> 01:17:09,108
And the Holy Spirit makes him alive to us.


917
01:17:09,108 --> 01:17:10,388
And he walks with me


918
01:17:10,388 --> 01:17:11,828
and he talks with me


919
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:13,668
and he tells me I am his own


920
01:17:13,668 --> 01:17:16,548
and the joy we share as we tarry there.


921
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,548
Nobody has ever known.


922
01:17:18,548 --> 01:17:22,548
Oh, that's that's uh that's emotionalism, fanaticism.


923
01:17:22,548 --> 01:17:25,268
No, it's the truth about the Christian religion.


924
01:17:25,268 --> 01:17:30,308
There's no such a thing as the Holy Spirit in any religion on the face of this earth.


925
01:17:31,668 --> 01:17:34,388
God Almighty living inside of us


926
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:36,948
showing us things that we have right now.


927
01:17:44,228 --> 01:17:45,668
But I have to leave this with you


928
01:17:45,668 --> 01:17:48,468
because all during the night God kept waking me up


929
01:17:48,468 --> 01:17:51,028
and telling me that I should give you this verse


930
01:17:51,028 --> 01:17:57,348
which happens to be the Old Testament part of the illusion that Paul made, Isaiah 64.


931
01:17:57,348 --> 01:18:01,028
And now I'm praying the Holy Spirit will make this real to you.


932
01:18:01,028 --> 01:18:03,348
Look what Isaiah said way back then.


933
01:18:04,468 --> 01:18:07,268
Since ancient times, no one has heard


934
01:18:07,268 --> 01:18:08,628
no ear has perceived


935
01:18:08,628 --> 01:18:09,748
no eye has seen.


936
01:18:09,748 --> 01:18:16,708
Any God beside you who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.


937
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:19,348
Look, who acts on behalf.


938
01:18:19,348 --> 01:18:23,428
Almighty God acts on behalf of those who wait for him.


939
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:27,588
You know what some of the translations have?


940
01:18:27,588 --> 01:18:30,628
Because it's the same play on the verb.


941
01:18:30,628 --> 01:18:32,948
He works for those who wait for him.


942
01:18:33,988 --> 01:18:37,028
When you and I trust God and expect him


943
01:18:37,028 --> 01:18:38,548
and we're not gonna panic


944
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:40,308
and we're not gonna get discouraged


945
01:18:40,308 --> 01:18:44,468
and morose and depressed and bitter


946
01:18:44,468 --> 01:18:46,468
because life isn't working out.


947
01:18:46,468 --> 01:18:49,668
He works for those who take their positions and say, God


948
01:18:49,668 --> 01:18:54,308
I believe in you and I'm waiting for you to do what only you can do.


949
01:18:54,308 --> 01:18:55,908
I've tried, I've struggled


950
01:18:55,908 --> 01:18:57,988
I've gotten frustrated, but God


951
01:18:57,988 --> 01:18:58,788
I give it to you


952
01:18:58,788 --> 01:19:01,428
and I'm waiting for you, Lord.


953
01:19:01,428 --> 01:19:02,948
He works for that person.


954
01:19:02,948 --> 01:19:06,228
Today, if you'll take a position of waiting for God


955
01:19:06,228 --> 01:19:08,708
the thing you've prayed about, the wayward child


956
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:10,868
whatever your situation is, you prayed


957
01:19:10,868 --> 01:19:12,708
you don't see anything happening yet.


958
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,388
Wait for God.


959
01:19:14,388 --> 01:19:16,148
Wait on God.


960
01:19:16,148 --> 01:19:18,708
Some translations have who trust in God


961
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:20,708
because the word means trust and wait


962
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:22,468
like you expectantly wait.


963
01:19:22,468 --> 01:19:26,228
My cousin told me he's gonna meet me on this corner on Atlantic Avenue


964
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:28,548
and Bond Street at 11 o'clock.


965
01:19:28,548 --> 01:19:30,228
I'm gonna I know he's coming.


966
01:19:30,228 --> 01:19:31,188
I'm waiting for him.


967
01:19:31,188 --> 01:19:32,548
I know, but he's not here yet.


968
01:19:32,548 --> 01:19:35,348
Trust me, my cousin's coming.


969
01:19:35,348 --> 01:19:36,548
He's coming.


970
01:19:36,548 --> 01:19:38,308
He would call me if he wasn't coming.


971
01:19:38,308 --> 01:19:39,428
And God is saying


972
01:19:39,428 --> 01:19:41,188
just wait for me.


973
01:19:41,188 --> 01:19:43,988
My time is not always your time.


974
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:45,668
But wait for me.


975
01:19:45,668 --> 01:19:47,908
Don't get bitter, don't get discouraged.


976
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,668
Up in the balcony, stop it.


977
01:19:49,668 --> 01:19:51,508
Stop that discouragement.


978
01:19:51,508 --> 01:19:52,388
Wait for God.


979
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:55,108
Tell God, God, I love you and I trust you.


980
01:19:55,108 --> 01:19:57,108
Now work for me because I'm waiting.


981
01:19:57,108 --> 01:19:59,428
The world says, No, you work.


982
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:01,508
No, the old saying, not biblical


983
01:20:01,508 --> 01:20:05,268
God helps those who that's not in the Bible.


984
01:20:05,268 --> 01:20:08,068
God helps those who trust in him


985
01:20:08,068 --> 01:20:09,188
who wait on him.


986
01:20:09,188 --> 01:20:11,348
Come on, let's clap our hands one more time.


987
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,548
Come on, singer.


988
01:20:16,068 --> 01:20:20,228
The Holy Spirit wants you to know today in your heart


989
01:20:20,228 --> 01:20:24,196
He works for those who wait for Him.


990
01:20:24,196 --> 01:20:25,316
Say it with me.


991
01:20:25,316 --> 01:20:28,036
He works for those who wait for him.


992
01:20:28,036 --> 01:20:29,076
Another one.


993
01:20:29,076 --> 01:20:32,116
He works for those who wait for him.


994
01:20:32,116 --> 01:20:33,236
Even louder.


995
01:20:33,236 --> 01:20:36,036
He works for those who wait for him.


996
01:20:37,236 --> 01:20:39,956
The human, the culture says that's a joke.


997
01:20:39,956 --> 01:20:40,996
But God says, no


998
01:20:40,996 --> 01:20:43,156
that's my special wisdom.


999
01:20:43,156 --> 01:20:44,116
I reverse.


1000
01:20:44,116 --> 01:20:46,596
What the world calls great is a joke to God.


1001
01:20:46,596 --> 01:20:48,676
It's an abomination sometimes.


1002
01:20:48,676 --> 01:20:50,196
And what the world laughs at


1003
01:20:50,196 --> 01:20:52,036
that's the true wisdom.


1004
01:20:52,036 --> 01:20:53,956
Oh, praise God.


1005
01:20:53,956 --> 01:20:57,236
Oh, aren't you happy the Holy Spirit's worked in your life


1006
01:20:57,236 --> 01:20:59,636
and your members of the body of Christ?


1007
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:03,156
Praise God.


1008
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:05,956
I don't want to do an altar call.


1009
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:09,716
But I want you to wait for him.


1010
01:21:09,716 --> 01:21:10,436
I'm telling you


1011
01:21:10,436 --> 01:21:14,116
God kept waking me up during the night almost like this.


1012
01:21:14,116 --> 01:21:17,396
Tell them, I work for those who wait for me.


1013
01:21:17,396 --> 01:21:18,676
I will never fail them.


1014
01:21:18,676 --> 01:21:19,396
Look at me.


1015
01:21:19,396 --> 01:21:20,916
He will never fail you.


1016
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:22,436
Your friends will fail you.


1017
01:21:22,436 --> 01:21:24,036
Your spouse will fail you.


1018
01:21:24,036 --> 01:21:25,396
Your mother will fail you.


1019
01:21:25,396 --> 01:21:26,836
Your father will fail you.


1020
01:21:26,836 --> 01:21:28,196
The government will fail you.


1021
01:21:28,196 --> 01:21:29,396
Everything will fail you.


1022
01:21:29,396 --> 01:21:30,596
God cannot fail.


1023
01:21:30,596 --> 01:21:32,356
Come on, God cannot fail.


1024
01:21:39,716 --> 01:21:41,716
Right where you're sitting, sing loud.


1025
01:22:13,156 --> 01:22:14,036
So arise.


1026
01:22:58,596 --> 01:23:00,836
Everybody stand, stand and sing.


1027
01:23:07,236 --> 01:23:08,676
Of your presence.


1028
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:11,956
Holy Spirit.


1029
01:23:11,956 --> 01:23:13,796
Holy Spirit, we honor you.


1030
01:23:13,796 --> 01:23:14,676
Holy Spirit.


1031
01:23:14,676 --> 01:23:15,876
We honor you.


1032
01:23:17,236 --> 01:23:19,156
Show us things.


1033
01:23:19,156 --> 01:23:21,316
Give us revelation.


1034
01:23:21,316 --> 01:23:24,116
Show us how wonderful our Jesus really is.


1035
01:23:29,636 --> 01:23:30,836
Come on, sick now.


1036
01:23:30,836 --> 01:23:31,716
So around.


1037
01:24:17,156 --> 01:24:18,356
From the beginning.


1038
01:24:47,076 --> 01:24:48,276
Let's lift our hands.


1039
01:24:48,276 --> 01:24:49,076
Lift your hands.


1040
01:24:49,076 --> 01:25:45,876
Say South Swimming.


1041
01:26:51,076 --> 01:27:06,436
For his praise and while the band plays.


1042
01:27:06,436 --> 01:27:07,636
Just lift up your voice


1043
01:27:07,636 --> 01:27:09,236
and praise God while they play.


1044
01:27:09,236 --> 01:27:10,676
Everybody.


1045
01:27:10,676 --> 01:27:13,556
In the name of Jesus, praise the living God.


1046
01:29:10,356 --> 01:29:11,796
Sing over these people


1047
01:29:11,796 --> 01:29:19,156
sing we bless the name.


1048
01:29:19,156 --> 01:29:21,076
I praise the name.


1049
01:29:21,076 --> 01:29:22,756
I glorify the names.


1050
01:30:08,596 --> 01:30:09,956
The hidden wisdom.


1051
01:30:11,236 --> 01:30:17,236
Thank you that you've made us wiser than the wisest people


1052
01:30:17,236 --> 01:30:21,476
on the face of the earth who only know their minds


1053
01:30:21,476 --> 01:30:24,756
and what they can see and touch and feel.


1054
01:30:24,756 --> 01:30:28,916
You've given us a revelation of the world to come


1055
01:30:28,916 --> 01:30:31,876
and the things of God that are available to us right now.


1056
01:30:31,876 --> 01:30:33,476
Holy Spirit.


1057
01:30:33,476 --> 01:30:36,356
Please do a deeper work in all of us.


1058
01:30:36,356 --> 01:30:39,156
Help my friends here in the front.


1059
01:30:39,156 --> 01:30:40,516
They're not gonna die


1060
01:30:40,516 --> 01:30:42,756
they're gonna live.


1061
01:30:42,756 --> 01:30:44,036
They're not going down


1062
01:30:44,036 --> 01:30:45,156
they're going up.


1063
01:30:46,276 --> 01:30:48,276
They're not gonna be knocked down


1064
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,236
they're gonna get up and move on, Lord.


1065
01:30:51,236 --> 01:30:52,356
With Jesus.


1066
01:30:55,636 --> 01:30:58,276
Help us to glory in our position as sons


1067
01:30:58,276 --> 01:31:00,436
and daughters of the living God.


1068
01:31:00,436 --> 01:31:05,636
We're not jealous of one big kind person on the face of the earth.


1069
01:31:05,636 --> 01:31:08,836
They're nothing compared with knowing Jesus Christ.


1070
01:31:10,676 --> 01:31:11,956
Thank you for the service.


1071
01:31:13,396 --> 01:31:15,076
Thank you, we can praise you.


1072
01:31:17,876 --> 01:31:20,116
Be with us the rest of the day.


1073
01:31:20,116 --> 01:31:24,196
Bless the offering, bless the first time visitors downstairs.


1074
01:31:24,196 --> 01:31:25,716
Bless everything.


1075
01:31:25,716 --> 01:31:28,516
Bless, bless, bless, bless, bless.


1076
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:33,156
So we can bless others with the blessing we've received from you.


1077
01:31:33,156 --> 01:31:34,596
In Jesus' name.


1078
01:31:36,836 --> 01:31:38,916
We're gonna sing once or twice more.


1079
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:39,956
Greet one another.


1080
01:31:39,956 --> 01:31:41,556
You may go as you see fit


1081
01:31:41,556 --> 01:31:43,076
or you can stay and sing with us


1082
01:31:43,076 --> 01:31:44,596
whatever you'd like to do.
