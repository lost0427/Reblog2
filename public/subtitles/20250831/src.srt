00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:47,989
They got up there safely.
 

180
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:50,471
They were there safely
 

181
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:53,432
when some terrible things were happening
 

182
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,542
in other parts of the country.
 

183
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:58,125
Let me know what I'm talking about.
 

184
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,244
Unspeakable things.
 

185
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:01,547
God not only kept them
 

186
00:19:01,547 --> 00:19:03,048
they not only had fun.
 

187
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:04,088
I've talked to two
 

188
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:07,790
and I said to my wife after talking to two,
 

189
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,012
one 10-year-old, one 9-year-old, Carol
 

190
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:12,594
they met God at that camp.
 

191
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:21,079
And I found out from counselors and people who were there, God came.
 

192
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:26,801
touched those children, anointed those children.
 

193
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:28,123
They met God.
 

194
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:30,105
One came back and all she wants to know is
 

195
00:19:30,105 --> 00:19:31,827
you got to get me a devotional.
 

196
00:19:31,827 --> 00:19:33,988
I got to start reading every single day.
 

197
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:35,470
So God is working.
 

198
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,792
We prayed very intensely for that.
 

199
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:41,174
And I am very thankful.
 

200
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:42,915
You can't go on to the next problem.
 

201
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,378
You have to thank God for what he did.
 

202
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:47,236
We also prayed that night.
 

203
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:51,118
Because on Wednesday morning, about 15 of the people behind me
 

204
00:19:51,118 --> 00:19:53,662
some pastors and security people
 

205
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:59,846
we went to Angola Prison in Louisiana and near Baton Rouge.
 

206
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:00,867
And we were there.
 

207
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,269
They did two concerts.
 

208
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,971
I spoke twice.
 

209
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:05,771
And we got a chance to visit.
 

210
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,814
There's 4,200 inmates there.
 

211
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:10,516
Average sentence, 91 years.
 

212
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:12,037
We went on death row.
 

213
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:13,259
And now it's new.
 

214
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,568
They open up the cells.
 

215
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:16,769
So that they can come out
 

216
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:18,330
and mingle on the tier
 

217
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,451
and you can talk to them.
 

218
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:24,574
We met someone who had just received Christ a couple months before
 

219
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:26,234
and just gotten baptized.
 

220
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:27,736
Some didn't want to talk to us.
 

221
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:29,577
Some stayed in their cell.
 

222
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:35,121
But we visited all kinds of men that were there.
 

223
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:39,835
And we had these two jam-packed meetings where the gospel went out.
 

224
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:41,096
And God gave us
 

225
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:42,976
of all the times I've been there
 

226
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,436
that was the most blessed time we ever had.
 

227
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:46,478
Why?
 

228
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,617
Because among other things
 

229
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:51,199
Pastor Burgos stood right where I'm standing on Tuesday night
 

230
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,779
and he prayed an anointed prayer
 

231
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:57,382
just like an anointed prayer was prayed for by the children, by,
 

232
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,143
I believe, Pastor Luke.
 

233
00:20:59,143 --> 00:21:00,343
And it was, God
 

234
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,923
please bless us so we can be a blessing.
 

235
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:04,163
And I'm telling you
 

236
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,065
I am so thankful today
 

237
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,566
because I was speaking
 

238
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,032
I had a Sprained ankle.
 

239
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:13,773
I had all these distractions.
 

240
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,315
But I had freedom.
 

241
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,694
I felt the Lord helping me when I spoke.
 

242
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,875
When that group sang
 

243
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,115
they sang like angels.
 

244
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:24,656
And the way they were received by the inmates.
 

245
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:27,337
And, you know, oh, God.
 

246
00:21:27,337 --> 00:21:28,678
Come on, put your hands together.
 

247
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:31,479
Dios ha sido bueno.
 

248
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,480
Dios ha sido bueno.
 

249
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,340
Yeah.
 

250
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,541
Dios ha sido bueno.
 

251
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,723
Maybe you have a Thanksgiving, a special one.
 

252
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:41,483
Mine is fresh.
 

253
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:44,046
Mine is fresh.
 

254
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:45,767
A fresh Thanksgiving.
 

255
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:50,530
And maybe God this very week did something for you.
 

256
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,652
Answered a prayer.
 

257
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:53,232
Lifted you out of a pit.
 

258
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:56,295
Helped you on your way.
 

259
00:21:57,737 --> 00:22:00,778
And when I met the Christians on death row
 

260
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,020
we met one Bobby Hampton
 

261
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,969
who's been a friend of mine now for a long time.
 

262
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:09,589
And he's been in death row a long time.
 

263
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:10,651
And he has a great voice.
 

264
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:11,530
He began to sing.
 

265
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,192
It was a great thing that he did for me.
 

266
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:16,993
And he was full of thanksgiving.
 

267
00:22:16,993 --> 00:22:18,035
He's on death row.
 

268
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:21,115
But he has Jesus.
 

269
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:22,596
And when you have Jesus
 

270
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:25,218
you're on life row every day of your life.
 

271
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:25,617
Amen?
 

272
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:27,779
You're not on death row.
 

273
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,519
You're on life row.
 

274
00:22:29,906 --> 00:22:32,088
So if the Lord's been good to you and helps you
 

275
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:33,269
come up out of your seat
 

276
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,713
and we're going to teach these southern people how to sing in Spanish.
 

277
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:41,676
This song means God has been good.
 

278
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,779
Oh, Dios ha sido bueno.
 

279
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,740
They'll hear it once and sing with us.
 

280
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,623
But you come up with your thanksgiving.
 

281
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:49,763
Come on, let's sing.
 

282
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:54,387
Dios ha sido bueno.
 

283
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:06,750
Come on and thank the Lord.
 

284
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:17,718
Let the church sing now.
 

285
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:34,440
God has been good God has been good
 

286
00:23:34,440 --> 00:24:02,352
God has been Let your hands sing louder now, everyone.
 

287
00:24:02,352 --> 00:24:07,576
Gracias, Señor.
 

288
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:13,141
Gracias, Señor.
 

289
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:14,142
Gracias, Señor.
 

290
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:33,788
Last time, sing.
 

291
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:37,130
You have been so good.
 

292
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:46,977
You have been so good.
 

293
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:51,799
Gloria to all persons.
 

294
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:59,493
Last line.
 

295
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:32,195
We praise you, Lord.
 

296
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:33,457
Let's praise them together.
 

297
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:37,641
Thank you for every blessing.
 

298
00:25:38,922 --> 00:25:40,663
We thank you for the blessing today
 

299
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:43,325
that there's breath in our lungs
 

300
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:44,606
and that we're alive today.
 

301
00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:46,468
Not everyone's alive.
 

302
00:25:46,468 --> 00:25:49,911
We are alive because of your grace and mercy.
 

303
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:51,853
Bless the meeting.
 

304
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:53,394
We give it to you.
 

305
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:54,555
Lead us, guide us
 

306
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:57,352
do whatever that needs to be done today.
 

307
00:25:57,352 --> 00:25:59,593
But God, I pray in Jesus' name
 

308
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,634
let the people go home
 

309
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:05,234
and leave this building with the name of Jesus on their lips
 

310
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:06,736
praising and thanking him.
 

311
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,636
Thank you for all you do for us.
 

312
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,837
In Christ's name, amen.
 

313
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,961
When you feel your life's a battle
 

314
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:27,150
and you're headed for defeat, Oh, remember
 

315
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,715
Jesus promised that you would have everything you need.
 

316
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,818
So don't you dare give up on him.
 

317
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:37,742
Keep on holding on until you win.
 

318
00:26:37,742 --> 00:26:40,205
The Lord is with the little of it.
 

319
00:26:40,205 --> 00:26:42,108
He's working it out for you.
 

320
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:47,869
Now it can feel like Satan busy
 

321
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:50,711
trying to take your joy.
 

322
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:56,292
Oh, remember, all the devil wants is to steal, kill, and destroy.
 

323
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:58,894
So don't you dab on the towel
 

324
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:02,275
and keep on fighting until you win.
 

325
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:04,796
The Lord is in the middle of it.
 

326
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:06,616
He's working it out for you.
 

327
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:12,948
So stay with God and don't give up.
 

328
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:16,169
Be of good courage.
 

329
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:21,050
Be of good courage.
 

330
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:27,152
So stay with God and don't give up.
 

331
00:27:27,152 --> 00:27:28,593
He's working in our lives.
 

332
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:40,231
Now if you feel like Satan's busy trying to take your joy, oh
 

333
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:45,275
remember all the devil wants is to steal, kill, and destroy.
 

334
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:48,196
So don't you dare throw the towel.
 

335
00:27:48,196 --> 00:27:50,377
It's people fighting.
 

336
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,519
You're going to win.
 

337
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:57,868
He's working it out for you.
 

338
00:27:57,868 --> 00:28:03,109
So stay with us and don't give up.
 

339
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:05,971
We have good courage.
 

340
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:10,372
We have good courage.
 

341
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:16,353
So stay with us and don't give up.
 

342
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:20,554
He's working it out for you.
 

343
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:27,519
It's working it out God is working it out
 

344
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,723
Don't have no doubt God is working it out
 

345
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,742
He's working it out.
 

346
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:42,163
He's working it out.
 

347
00:28:42,163 --> 00:28:45,964
He's working it out.
 

348
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:06,811
He's working it out for you.
 

349
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,386
Now, if you're like me
 

350
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:31,367
and you need to know the Lord is working it out
 

351
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:32,327
I need you to stand up
 

352
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:35,067
and praise him before he works it out.
 

353
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:37,148
Because he will, because he is faithful.
 

354
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:40,969
He's working it out.
 

355
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:42,190
He's working it out.
 

356
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,130
The Lord is working it out.
 

357
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,970
He's working it out.
 

358
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,550
Don't have no doubt.
 

359
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,590
He's working it out.
 

360
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,310
The Lord is working it out.
 

361
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,191
He's working it out.
 

362
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:53,471
Oh yeah,
 

363
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:54,231
he's working.
 

364
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:54,832
Working.
 

365
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:55,051
Working.
 

366
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:55,711
In the morning.
 

367
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,797
He's working it out
 

368
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:02,118
he's working it out.
 

369
00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:05,363
So don't you doubt
 

370
00:30:05,363 --> 00:30:07,145
cause the time will end.
 

371
00:30:07,145 --> 00:30:12,491
Keep on fighting, you're gonna win.
 

372
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,233
He's working it out for you.
 

373
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:29,838
Praise the Lord.
 

374
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,681
He is working for our good.
 

375
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:34,141
Amen.
 

376
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:36,862
Hallelujah.
 

377
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:37,942
Thank you, Jesus.
 

378
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:41,163
Come on, let's put our hands together for Jesus.
 

379
00:30:43,055 --> 00:30:45,096
Oh, we praise you, Lord.
 

380
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:53,177
I've been walking to a city I cannot see.
 

381
00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:56,138
Through the depths of the valley
 

382
00:30:56,138 --> 00:31:00,039
where the sun can't reach.
 

383
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,860
I've been high and I've been low.
 

384
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,880
I've been looking for the river that can fill my soul.
 

385
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,721
I've been walking to a city I cannot see.
 

386
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,923
Fill my cup Lord, run it over.
 

387
00:31:16,923 --> 00:31:21,306
Give me love, give me joy, give me peace.
 

388
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:27,110
Fill my cup Lord, run it over.
 

389
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:32,213
I am a child in need.
 

390

Fill my cup.
 

391
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:46,938
I've been walking over the line
 

392
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,561
standing in my way.
 

393
00:31:51,156 --> 00:31:52,577
They can say what they want
 

394
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:59,142
I don't want what they say Cause I was born far from home
 

395
00:31:59,142 --> 00:32:02,444
And I've been thriving in the wonder of the great unknown
 

396
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:07,728
Cause I'm drinking from a well from another place
 

397
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:10,450
Fill my cup, Lord
 

398
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:16,234
and run it over Give me love, give me joy
 

399
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:21,883
give me peace Fill my cup
 

400
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:28,587
Lord, because I am your child
 

401
00:32:28,587 --> 00:32:30,588
oh Lord I need tears.
 

402
00:32:30,588 --> 00:32:32,269

Fill my chains up with purpose.
 

407
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:51,750
Fill my wounds up with need.
 

408
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,911
Oh, I need you.
 

409
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:54,292
Fill myself.
 

410
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:56,814
Fill my chains up with need.
 

411
00:32:56,814 --> 00:32:59,656
Fill my future with vision.
 

412
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:02,278
Goodness, grace, and provision.
 

413
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:03,018
Oh, I need you.
 

414
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:09,892
Fill my heart with love.
 

415
00:33:09,892 --> 00:33:12,734
Fill my heart with love.
 

416
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:16,856
Fill my heart with love.
 

417
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:18,316

Fill my heart with love.
 

423
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:40,925
Fill my cup, Lord.
 

424
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:41,985
Run it over.
 

425
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:43,746
Would you give me love?
 

426
00:33:43,746 --> 00:33:45,147
Give me love.
 

427
00:33:45,147 --> 00:33:47,128
Give me joy.

00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:04,298

God Almighty, the Great I Am.
 

476
00:44:30,816 --> 00:44:33,678
The Great I Am.
 

477
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:42,033
The mountains shake before you
 

478
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:45,554
the demons run and flee.
 

479
00:44:45,554 --> 00:44:50,875
At the mention of the name, King of Majesty
 

480
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:53,236
there is no power in hell
 

481
00:44:53,236 --> 00:44:58,938
or any who can stand before the power
 

482
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:03,815
and the presence of the Great I Am.
 

483
00:45:03,815 --> 00:45:06,818

He's the great and whole.

00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:30,017
Yes, you are, Lord.
 

492

00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:37,520

494
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,762
Holy, holy.
 

495
00:46:40,762 --> 00:46:43,843
God Almighty.
 

496
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:47,464
The great I Am.
 

497
00:46:47,464 --> 00:46:50,946
Who is worthy.
 

498
00:46:50,946 --> 00:46:54,287
None beside Thee.
 

499
00:46:54,287 --> 00:46:56,668
God Almighty.
 

500
00:46:57,724 --> 00:46:59,325
The Great I Am.
 

501
00:46:59,325 --> 00:47:02,166
Oh, you sound so good.
 

502
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:03,247
He's the Great I Am.
 

503
00:47:03,247 --> 00:47:06,328
Yes, he is.
 

504
00:47:06,328 --> 00:47:07,488
The Great I Am.
 

505
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:10,950
This is a song we'll sing in heaven together.
 

506
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:15,152
I'm sneaking into that Brooklyn section in heaven.
 

507
00:47:15,152 --> 00:47:16,132
I'm sneaking over there.
 

508
00:47:18,613 --> 00:47:19,594
It's so good to be home.
 

509
00:47:26,673 --> 00:47:28,995
To your wonderful pastors, Pastor Semblem,
 

510
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:31,577
Ms. Carroll, the leadership of the church,
 

511
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:35,099
and all you wonderful, wonderful saints of God.
 

512
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:38,001
We haven't been here since the pandemic.
 

513
00:47:38,001 --> 00:47:39,863
I've just been sitting at home pouting
 

514
00:47:39,863 --> 00:47:42,905
because we wanted to be here.
 

515
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:44,886
We wanted to be here.
 

516
00:47:44,886 --> 00:47:48,309
You have impacted our lives in so many, many ways.
 

517
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,131
The song we're about to do
 

518
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:53,713
we recorded on several albums ago.
 

519
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:58,088
The record company said
 

520
00:47:58,088 --> 00:47:59,628
we don't want you to do this song.
 

521
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:02,188
We don't want you to put it on the album.
 

522
00:48:03,229 --> 00:48:05,629
The song has already been recorded.
 

523
00:48:05,629 --> 00:48:06,329
It's too long.
 

524
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:10,010
And just don't think you need to do it.
 

525
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:10,950
Take up a space.
 

526
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,111
Well, that didn't sit too well with us.
 

527
00:48:15,171 --> 00:48:17,632
But we wanted to respect them as the record company.
 

528
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:20,732
Unfortunately for them, we came to Brooklyn.
 

529
00:48:22,773 --> 00:48:23,913
And we sang this song.
 

530
00:48:26,297 --> 00:48:27,438
With that great choir
 

531
00:48:28,598 --> 00:48:30,099
when we left this stage
 

532
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:31,559
when we left this platform
 

533
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,161
the very first call on Monday morning was
 

534
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:36,221
we're doing the song.
 

535
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:38,943
And this is the song.
 

536
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:13,457
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
 

537
00:49:14,637 --> 00:49:17,640
Holy, holy is he.
 

538
00:49:21,643 --> 00:49:31,330
Sing a new song to him who sits on heaven's mercy seat.
 

539
00:49:35,792 --> 00:49:42,835
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
 

540
00:49:42,835 --> 00:49:46,377
Holy, holy is He.
 

541
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:59,783
Sing a new song to Him who sits on heaven's mercy seat.
 

542
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:11,695
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was
 

543
00:50:11,695 --> 00:50:16,038
and is and is to come.
 

544
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:24,706
With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings.
 

545
00:50:24,706 --> 00:50:27,728
You are my everything
 

546
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:31,171
and I will adore you.
 

547
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:46,090
Oh, I will adore you again.
 

548
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:52,958
De en arco iris estás vestido.
 

549
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:57,302
Tu voz resueno como los reinos.
 

550
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:12,410
Recibe honor y gloria, poder y majestad, a ti el único Rey.
 

551
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:21,153
Hey! Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
 

552
00:51:21,153 --> 00:51:26,575
who was and is and is to come.
 

553
00:51:26,575 --> 00:51:27,176
Yeah!
 

554
00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:35,282
With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings.
 

555
00:51:35,282 --> 00:51:38,304
You are my everything
 

556
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:47,748
and I will adore you.
 

557
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:50,950
You are holy.
 

558
00:51:57,001 --> 00:51:59,823
Fill with wonder, sing it
 

559
00:52:00,844 --> 00:52:09,031
all struggle wonder at the mention of your name.
 

560
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:17,738
Jesus, your name is power, breath and living water.
 

561
00:52:17,738 --> 00:52:21,921
Serve the marvelous mystery.
 

562
00:52:25,211 --> 00:52:32,856
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty Who was
 

563
00:52:32,856 --> 00:52:36,578
and is and is to come
 

564
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:45,868
With all creation I say praise to the King of kings.
 

565
00:52:45,868 --> 00:52:48,870
You are my everything
 

566
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,011
and I will adore you.
 

567
00:52:51,011 --> 00:53:01,098
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was
 

568
00:53:01,098 --> 00:53:03,199
and is and is to come.
 

569
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:07,330
We sing holy.
 

570
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:14,133
With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings.
 

571
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:17,075
You are my everything
 

572
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:19,556
and I will adore you.
 

573
00:53:27,381 --> 00:53:57,748
you are holy Amen.
 

574
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,332
Let's hear it for Phillips, Craig and Dean.
 

575
00:54:05,734 --> 00:54:06,074
Amen.
 

576
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:10,797
You may be seated.
 

577
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:14,920
Last Sunday, you got to tell it like it is when you're the pastor.
 

578
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,543
I think that was the lowest offering we've had in like six years.
 

579
00:54:18,543 --> 00:54:20,324
That's the truth.
 

580
00:54:21,645 --> 00:54:22,811
Why?
 

581
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:23,672
I don't know.
 

582
00:54:23,672 --> 00:54:24,613
Do you?
 

583
00:54:24,613 --> 00:54:25,333
I don't know.
 

584
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,915
I've never figured it out.
 

585
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:28,656
All I know is that God is faithful.
 

586
00:54:29,697 --> 00:54:31,178
So he's going to bring us back.
 

587
00:54:31,178 --> 00:54:31,959
Would you help us?
 

588
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,603
Watching online, we're falling behind here.
 

589
00:54:36,603 --> 00:54:39,365
It's called the Summer Doldrums.
 

590
00:54:39,365 --> 00:54:44,269
And there's an offering basket as you leave
 

591
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:46,371
but most people give online.
 

592
00:54:46,371 --> 00:54:48,353
Would you please be a part of that?
 

593
00:54:49,424 --> 00:54:53,046
and and help us because all these things we're doing
 

594
00:54:53,046 --> 00:54:56,068
and a lot of them involve money
 

595
00:54:56,068 --> 00:54:59,050
and you pay out and we need to see god supply
 

596
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,071
that through the giving of his people
 

597
00:55:01,071 --> 00:55:04,893
lord i pray publicly in front of the people
 

598
00:55:04,893 --> 00:55:07,475
my eyes are not on the people my eyes are on you
 

599
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:11,858
you have been faithful over the decades
 

600
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:16,545
would you show your faithfulness again
 

601
00:55:16,545 --> 00:55:18,346
You've been good to us personally.
 

602
00:55:18,346 --> 00:55:20,887
Help us to be good now to your work.
 

603
00:55:20,887 --> 00:55:21,807
In Jesus name.
 

604
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:23,287
Amen.
 

605
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:29,290
Forgive the personal reference
 

606
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:33,491
but I was a kind of off the wall kid growing up in Brooklyn.
 

607
00:55:33,491 --> 00:55:36,312
Because of my father's drinking
 

608
00:55:36,312 --> 00:55:39,770
I tried to get out of the house as much as I could.
 

609
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,211
Played a lot of sports, especially basketball.
 

610
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:47,254
Got good enough to play at the biggest high school in the country,
 

611
00:55:47,254 --> 00:55:50,756
Rasmus Hall High School at that time, 7,800 students.
 

612
00:55:52,297 --> 00:55:54,639
And all in one year, a lot happened.
 

613
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:58,701
And I made an all-city game in Madison Square Garden
 

614
00:55:58,701 --> 00:56:00,802
and was recruited by some schools.
 

615
00:56:00,802 --> 00:56:05,145
And one of the schools was the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.
 

616
00:56:06,194 --> 00:56:08,376
And they sent me to prep school
 

617
00:56:08,376 --> 00:56:10,237
because I had skipped a grade.
 

618
00:56:10,237 --> 00:56:13,720
But my mom and dad thought in a military kind of prep school
 

619
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,322
and then at the Naval Academy
 

620
00:56:16,322 --> 00:56:17,924
I would be under lock and key
 

621
00:56:17,924 --> 00:56:20,225
and I would not be able to be goofing off.
 

622
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:23,288
So when I went to the Naval Academy
 

623
00:56:23,288 --> 00:56:25,810
there was a lot of apprehension because when you go in
 

624
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,191
you're called a plebe, P-L-E-B-E, a plebe.
 

625
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:33,282
Upperclassmen are sophomore, juniors, and seniors
 

626
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:36,043
but they're called third, second, and first classmen.
 

627
00:56:37,183 --> 00:56:39,944
And they haze you when you're there.
 

628
00:56:39,944 --> 00:56:42,005
They try to break you down.
 

629
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:42,685
I'm just speaking
 

630
00:56:42,685 --> 00:56:44,926
it was way worse before I went there.
 

631
00:56:44,926 --> 00:56:48,927
And they still haze
 

632
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:51,768
but it's lighter now from what I understand.
 

633
00:56:52,968 --> 00:56:54,348
But they can make you do anything.
 

634
00:56:54,348 --> 00:56:57,610
They try to break you down, pressure you, pressure you mentally,
 

635
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:59,716
emotionally, physically.
 

636
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:03,138
And all the upperclassmen could just walk in your room at any time
 

637
00:57:03,138 --> 00:57:05,860
take a white glove that you had to keep out
 

638
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,882
and start touching anywhere in your room.
 

639
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,363
And if there was dust
 

640
00:57:09,363 --> 00:57:12,004
you were in trouble and had to march the next day
 

641
00:57:12,004 --> 00:57:14,926
or run from five to six in the morning.
 

642
00:57:14,926 --> 00:57:16,808
And then shine your shoes
 

643
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,629
and make sure you're ready for inspection.
 

644
00:57:18,629 --> 00:57:20,570
So it was constant pressure
 

645
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,572
and a lot of the stuff I'm leaving out.
 

646
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:24,933
Because I was there
 

647
00:57:24,933 --> 00:57:26,134
they dummied up a
 

648
00:57:27,355 --> 00:57:29,680
you need to go to the academy today.
 

649
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:34,743
A recommendation, I'm not using the right word, but from a congressman
 

650
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:36,924
or from somewhere, an appointment
 

651
00:57:36,924 --> 00:57:39,185
they have to recommend you.
 

652
00:57:39,185 --> 00:57:44,648
So they got one from some congressman or someone in Utah
 

653
00:57:44,648 --> 00:57:45,308
and they got me
 

654
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:47,829
and I was there to hoop it up and play ball.
 

655
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:52,192
But that's not what everyone else was thinking.
 

656
00:57:52,192 --> 00:57:54,453
They didn't care how I played basketball.
 

657
00:57:54,453 --> 00:57:57,354
They were out to get me, like all the other plebs.
 

658
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:04,012
You're assigned when you go there a first classman, a senior
 

659
00:58:04,012 --> 00:58:06,193
who is a person who you can talk to.
 

660
00:58:06,193 --> 00:58:07,273
You don't have to call him sir.
 

661
00:58:07,273 --> 00:58:10,174
You can call him by his first name.
 

662
00:58:10,174 --> 00:58:13,256
And he's there to kind of walk you through things
 

663
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,136
and protect you a little bit.
 

664
00:58:15,136 --> 00:58:17,157
I got a guy who was an athlete
 

665
00:58:17,157 --> 00:58:19,118
and four years ahead of me.
 

666
00:58:19,118 --> 00:58:25,461
So he was the guy who I could go to hide out in his room a little bit.
 

667
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:29,068
But he couldn't protect me from everything else that was going on.
 

668
00:58:29,068 --> 00:58:30,448
So what he did was
 

669
00:58:30,448 --> 00:58:32,089
since he had been through everything
 

670
00:58:32,089 --> 00:58:34,769
every midshipman has gone through plea beer
 

671
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:36,750
so they know the deal.
 

672
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,790
So he took me aside and he told me, all right
 

673
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:39,790
this is going to happen.
 

674
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,571
One day during your plea beer
 

675
00:58:42,571 --> 00:58:43,471
this is going to happen.
 

676
00:58:43,471 --> 00:58:46,011
Someone's going to come at you at the dining hall
 

677
00:58:46,011 --> 00:58:47,852
and start yelling at you
 

678
00:58:47,852 --> 00:58:52,253
and hope you spill stuff on yourself and lose your composure
 

679
00:58:52,253 --> 00:58:54,048
and then they're going to make you...
 

680
00:58:54,048 --> 00:58:57,869
sit under the table and say that you're a gross animal
 

681
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:00,730
and you don't deserve to be with human beings.
 

682
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,831
And sure enough, that happened to me.
 

683
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:09,213
And I ended up eating with everyone's shoes down there under the table
 

684
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:12,934
and march extra or just hassle you, just hassle you.
 

685
00:59:14,354 --> 00:59:15,654
And he told me
 

686
00:59:15,654 --> 00:59:17,815
so this could happen and that could happen
 

687
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:19,015
but don't worry about it.
 

688
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:21,869
You're going to get through that, that, that, that.
 

689
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:24,550
So for all journeys that we take
 

690
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:29,791
it's good to know some of the things that are going to happen to us.
 

691
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:31,591
Like a GPS will give you
 

692
00:59:31,591 --> 00:59:34,352
there's traffic up ahead, there's this
 

693
00:59:34,352 --> 00:59:35,992
there's a detour.
 

694
00:59:35,992 --> 00:59:39,773
And the Bible gives us that, too, in our journey to heaven.
 

695
00:59:39,773 --> 00:59:43,213
By the way, how many are planning to go to heaven for all eternity
 

696
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:45,754
because of faith in Jesus Christ?
 

697
00:59:45,754 --> 00:59:49,215
Well, along the way
 

698
00:59:49,215 --> 00:59:50,515
there's stuff that's going to happen.
 

699
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,327
And some of it is taught
 

700
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:57,015
just outwardly it's taught.
 

701
00:59:57,015 --> 00:59:59,156
and uh and then other way
 

702
00:59:59,156 --> 01:00:01,958
other times it's included in
 

703
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:04,759
what you would almost call extraneous talk
 

704
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:06,080
that's in the bible
 

705
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,102
you wonder if the bible is inspired i get i am the good shepherd
 

706
01:00:10,102 --> 01:00:12,443
i get that the lord is my shepherd i get
 

707
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:14,844
that the judge shall live by faith i got
 

708
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,525
that that's inspired by god
 

709
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:18,486
but there's a lot of other stuff in the bible
 

710
01:00:18,486 --> 01:00:20,967
and yet all scripture is inspired by god
 

711
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:23,769
so what is this other stuff in there for
 

712
01:00:23,769 --> 01:00:26,530
sometimes it takes a little digging or watching
 

713
01:00:27,538 --> 01:00:30,500
So, Paul is about to die.
 

714
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,762
This is the last letter the apostle Paul is going to write.
 

715
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:38,646
And the end of his journey is there, is near.
 

716
01:00:38,646 --> 01:00:40,767
And he's writing to a younger minister that...
 

717
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:47,131
And he's talking to Timothy.
 

718
01:00:47,131 --> 01:00:48,812
And this is the last chapter.
 

719
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,652
There were no chapters in this letter
 

720
01:00:50,652 --> 01:00:53,473
but this is the end of the last letter he's ever going to write.
 

721
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:58,174
So he says, for I'm already being poured out like a drink offering.
 

722
01:00:58,174 --> 01:01:02,615
He saw his life as a sacrificial gift to God.
 

723
01:01:02,615 --> 01:01:07,076
And the time for my departure is near, not my death departure.
 

724
01:01:07,076 --> 01:01:08,516
I'm leaving here to go there.
 

725
01:01:10,116 --> 01:01:11,156
Do I get a witness here?
 

726
01:01:11,156 --> 01:01:12,317
That's a good note.
 

727
01:01:12,317 --> 01:01:13,017
We're not dying.
 

728
01:01:13,017 --> 01:01:13,717
We're departing.
 

729
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:16,000
We're going to another place.
 

730
01:01:17,521 --> 01:01:19,443
I have fought the good fight.
 

731
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:21,505
I have finished the race.
 

732
01:01:21,505 --> 01:01:22,485
I have kept the faith.
 

733
01:01:22,485 --> 01:01:26,689
So he's saying the Christian life is about a good fight.
 

734
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,152
If you're not into spiritual warfare
 

735
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:32,554
if you don't want to resist other impulses
 

736
01:01:32,554 --> 01:01:34,515
you can't be a Christian.
 

737
01:01:34,515 --> 01:01:35,356
To be a Christian
 

738
01:01:35,356 --> 01:01:37,478
you have to be able to know
 

739
01:01:37,478 --> 01:01:38,759
that someone's coming at you
 

740
01:01:38,759 --> 01:01:42,542
but that you're going to be able to fight back.
 

741
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:45,921
Use the word of God as the sword of the spirit.
 

742
01:01:47,002 --> 01:01:50,024
Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
 

743
01:01:50,024 --> 01:01:52,186
But I don't want him to come at me.
 

744
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:53,047
Well, then wake up.
 

745
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:54,368
He's coming at you, right?
 

746
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:57,531
And they have to know how to resist him.
 

747
01:01:57,531 --> 01:01:58,612
I have finished the race.
 

748
01:01:58,612 --> 01:01:59,672
I have kept the faith.
 

749
01:02:01,874 --> 01:02:05,467
Now there's in store for me the crown of righteousness.
 

750
01:02:05,467 --> 01:02:07,508
which the Lord, the righteous judge
 

751
01:02:07,508 --> 01:02:09,069
will award to me on that day.
 

752
01:02:09,069 --> 01:02:13,511
And not only to me, but also to all in the Brooklyn Tabernacle
 

753
01:02:13,511 --> 01:02:16,253
who have longed for his appearing.
 

754
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:20,535
And now it totally changes.
 

755
01:02:20,535 --> 01:02:20,795
Go.
 

756
01:02:20,795 --> 01:02:24,578
Do your best to come to me quickly.
 

757
01:02:26,399 --> 01:02:27,879
Paul's in prison
 

758
01:02:27,879 --> 01:02:31,141
and he's telling Timothy
 

759
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:32,302
please come and visit me.
 

760
01:02:33,502 --> 01:02:34,283
Get to me, please.
 

761
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:40,692
Demas, an associate minister that traveled with Paul
 

762
01:02:40,692 --> 01:02:42,114
because he loved this world
 

763
01:02:42,114 --> 01:02:45,616
he's deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica.
 

764
01:02:45,616 --> 01:02:50,020
Crescens has gone to Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia.
 

765
01:02:51,741 --> 01:02:53,843
Only Luke is with me
 

766
01:02:53,843 --> 01:02:56,986
a Gentile doctor who had gotten converted.
 

767
01:02:56,986 --> 01:02:59,548
Get Mark, that's the one who wrote the book of Mark.
 

768
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:02,450
Get Mark and bring him with you
 

769
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,872
because he's helpful to me in my ministry.
 

770
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:08,680
I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
 

771
01:03:10,481 --> 01:03:12,181
When you come, bring the cloak
 

772
01:03:12,181 --> 01:03:15,923
that I left with Carpus at a place called Troas
 

773
01:03:15,923 --> 01:03:19,285
and bring my scrolls, hold this one, especially the parchments.
 

774
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:20,805
That's always been interesting.
 

775
01:03:20,805 --> 01:03:23,206
When you come, bring the cloak that I left.
 

776
01:03:23,206 --> 01:03:24,107
I'm in the prison
 

777
01:03:24,107 --> 01:03:25,487
and it's getting cold
 

778
01:03:25,487 --> 01:03:27,828
and they don't supply clothes here.
 

779
01:03:27,828 --> 01:03:29,009
This is not Angola.
 

780
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:31,850
This is not Rikers Island.
 

781
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,606
This is a Roman dungeon.
 

782
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:37,929
with rats running all up and down your grill.
 

783
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:40,111
So would you please bring the cloak?
 

784
01:03:40,111 --> 01:03:41,372
I have a cloak
 

785
01:03:41,372 --> 01:03:42,172
but I left it.
 

786
01:03:42,172 --> 01:03:43,453
Could you bring it to me so
 

787
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:44,895
that I can make it through the winter?
 

788
01:03:46,035 --> 01:03:50,859
And by the way, bring the scrolls, especially the parchments.
 

789
01:03:50,859 --> 01:03:51,960
Why are you still reading?
 

790
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,922
Why are you still studying?
 

791
01:03:53,922 --> 01:03:54,783
You're at the end.
 

792
01:03:54,783 --> 01:03:57,045
Why are you still digging and searching?
 

793
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:59,647
You've written a good part of the New Testament.
 

794
01:03:59,647 --> 01:04:03,164
No, he never stopped digging and searching and reading.
 

795
01:04:03,164 --> 01:04:05,445
It's a good lesson for all of us.
 

796
01:04:05,445 --> 01:04:07,706
Do I get a witness here, myself?
 

797
01:04:07,706 --> 01:04:09,266
You never stop studying.
 

798
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:12,687
When ministers, pastors, Christians stop reading the Bible
 

799
01:04:12,687 --> 01:04:14,228
every day and digging
 

800
01:04:14,228 --> 01:04:16,909
they go cold and they go backwards real quick.
 

801
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:20,490
You got to keep on keeping on.
 

802
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:21,990
So now he says
 

803
01:04:23,331 --> 01:04:27,492
Alexander the metal worker did me a great deal of harm.
 

804
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:29,693
The Lord will repay him for what he has done.
 

805
01:04:31,503 --> 01:04:33,424
You too should be on your guard against him
 

806
01:04:33,424 --> 01:04:35,605
because he strongly opposed our message.
 

807
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:38,306
Here's a warning about Alexander the metal worker.
 

808
01:04:39,826 --> 01:04:43,328
At my first defense before the judge there in Rome
 

809
01:04:43,328 --> 01:04:45,649
no one came to my support
 

810
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:47,229
but everyone deserted me.
 

811
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:52,163
They, listen, they got frightened.
 

812
01:04:52,163 --> 01:04:54,885
Paul was going to be called in front of a judge,
 

813
01:04:54,885 --> 01:04:56,867
probably get the death sentence.
 

814
01:04:56,867 --> 01:05:00,550
And if you stood there and vouch for him, they might say
 

815
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:01,510
we'll take you too.
 

816
01:05:02,511 --> 01:05:03,232
Take that guy.
 

817
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:08,196
So Paul knew what it was to be lonely at that moment.
 

818
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:09,297
They deserted.
 

819
01:05:09,297 --> 01:05:10,898
May it not be held against them.
 

820
01:05:12,919 --> 01:05:15,400
But the Lord stood at my side.
 

821
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,521
And gave me strength so
 

822
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:19,484
that through me the message might be fully proclaimed.
 

823
01:05:19,484 --> 01:05:21,526
And all the Gentiles might hear it.
 

824
01:05:21,526 --> 01:05:23,968
And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.
 

825
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:29,012
The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack.
 

826
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,815
And will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom.
 

827
01:05:31,815 --> 01:05:34,117
To him be glory forever and ever.
 

828
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:34,337
Amen.
 

829
01:05:35,527 --> 01:05:39,988
How in the world can you say that's inspired by the Holy Spirit
 

830
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:42,748
when it's a bunch of personal directives
 

831
01:05:42,748 --> 01:05:47,429
and inside talk between Paul and this young minister, Timothy?
 

832
01:05:48,589 --> 01:05:49,730
Well, what it is
 

833
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:54,310
it's reminders to us about tips for the journey.
 

834
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:58,351
All three of these things are going to happen to you and me.
 

835
01:05:58,351 --> 01:05:59,871
They've already happened to most of us.
 

836
01:06:01,592 --> 01:06:03,172
The rest will happen to us.
 

837
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:04,512
Number one.
 

838
01:06:04,512 --> 01:06:05,993
I just want to point out three people.
 

839
01:06:07,874 --> 01:06:10,975
Paul says to Timothy
 

840
01:06:10,975 --> 01:06:11,836
come to me quickly.
 

841
01:06:11,836 --> 01:06:13,256
He says, by the way
 

842
01:06:13,256 --> 01:06:17,358
Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world.
 

843
01:06:19,439 --> 01:06:22,681
There's a guy named Demas who's mentioned in the book of Colossians.
 

844
01:06:23,821 --> 01:06:27,483
And Demas was an associate, shall we say
 

845
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,864
minister who traveled with Paul.
 

846
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:31,385
This was the real deal.
 

847
01:06:31,385 --> 01:06:33,026
This is not some fly-by-night guy.
 

848
01:06:34,555 --> 01:06:35,896
He said, he's deserted me.
 

849
01:06:37,937 --> 01:06:39,738
Having loved this present world.
 

850
01:06:39,738 --> 01:06:41,700
Not only do I have problems
 

851
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:42,620
I've been busted
 

852
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:45,122
I'm in prison, I got persecution
 

853
01:06:45,122 --> 01:06:46,262
I got all of that happened
 

854
01:06:46,262 --> 01:06:49,585
but Demas has forsaken me.
 

855
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:51,005
Having loved this present world.
 

856
01:06:52,446 --> 01:06:54,288
So I want to tell all of you
 

857
01:06:54,288 --> 01:06:55,288
don't get shook
 

858
01:06:55,288 --> 01:06:56,569
don't get all riled up
 

859
01:06:56,569 --> 01:06:59,591
don't get all fit to be tied
 

860
01:06:59,591 --> 01:07:02,793
when people desert you and disappoint you and leave you.
 

861
01:07:04,193 --> 01:07:06,955
How many have had it already happen in your life, okay?
 

862
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,516
Folks are going to do that.
 

863
01:07:11,017 --> 01:07:13,619
Demas has forsaken me.
 

864
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:15,500
Personal disappointment.
 

865
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,201
I thought he was my man
 

866
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:18,682
part of my posse
 

867
01:07:18,682 --> 01:07:20,323
a guy who would stick with me.
 

868
01:07:20,323 --> 01:07:21,304
No, no, no.
 

869
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:26,447
When the pressure got hard, Demas said, adios, muchacho.
 

870
01:07:26,447 --> 01:07:27,387
I am out of here.
 

871
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:31,550
But it didn't make Paul explode.
 

872
01:07:32,752 --> 01:07:34,474
It didn't get him crazy
 

873
01:07:34,474 --> 01:07:37,096
because his eyes were never on Demas.
 

874
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:39,077
His eyes were always on Jesus.
 

875
01:07:40,298 --> 01:07:42,180
Brothers and sisters, look at me.
 

876
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,383
Never take your eyes off of Jesus.
 

877
01:07:45,383 --> 01:07:49,806
Put it on any man, any minister, any musician, any anyone
 

878
01:07:49,806 --> 01:07:52,549
and you might get really disappointed.
 

879
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:55,231
But if you keep your eyes on Jesus
 

880
01:07:55,231 --> 01:07:57,153
you will never be disappointed.
 

881
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:58,674
Can we say amen for that?
 

882
01:08:02,128 --> 01:08:04,189
When I was younger, before the ministry
 

883
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:08,492
I would see ministers in my future in-laws' house.
 

884
01:08:08,492 --> 01:08:11,995
And Carol's dad was a pastor.
 

885
01:08:11,995 --> 01:08:14,256
And I would see them in the pulpit.
 

886
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,297
And then they were staying at this house
 

887
01:08:16,297 --> 01:08:17,798
or would be over there for a meal.
 

888
01:08:17,798 --> 01:08:19,139
And then I'd get close to them.
 

889
01:08:19,139 --> 01:08:21,401
And when I got close to them, I was like, what?
 

890
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:23,422
That's the guy that was preaching?
 

891
01:08:23,422 --> 01:08:24,423
He's totally different.
 

892
01:08:25,804 --> 01:08:26,444
That's not good
 

893
01:08:26,444 --> 01:08:29,486
when a minister acts different in a pulpit than he is in real life.
 

894
01:08:30,547 --> 01:08:31,685
You know?
 

895
01:08:31,685 --> 01:08:35,888
I've seen extreme cases where, you know
 

896
01:08:35,888 --> 01:08:37,269
the minister will be
 

897
01:08:37,269 --> 01:08:38,710
and the Lord said, oh.
 

898
01:08:40,832 --> 01:08:44,135
And Jeremiah said, oh.
 

899
01:08:45,716 --> 01:08:48,658
So I was eating with one guy like that who was a friend.
 

900
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:50,379
And we were in juniors.
 

901
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:52,761
And I said, you know, you would
 

902
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:53,922
if you want my opinion
 

903
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:56,804
you would reach a lot more people if you were just more natural.
 

904
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,244
Because people can see through that.
 

905
01:09:01,244 --> 01:09:02,105
Am I correct or not?
 

906
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:04,386
And he said, what do you mean?
 

907
01:09:04,386 --> 01:09:06,827
I said, well, I've been eating with you.
 

908
01:09:06,827 --> 01:09:10,549
I never heard you say to the server, bring the ketchup.
 

909
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:15,072
You just don't talk like that.
 

910
01:09:16,993 --> 01:09:19,154
Well, why would you do that in front of the pulpit?
 

911
01:09:20,915 --> 01:09:21,736
Am I correct or not?
 

912
01:09:24,918 --> 01:09:25,098
So...
 

913
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:31,242
Demas personally disappointed Paul.
 

914
01:09:32,343 --> 01:09:34,865
And people will personally disappoint you.
 

915
01:09:36,186 --> 01:09:36,726
Fail you.
 

916
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:40,089
Sometimes turn on you.
 

917
01:09:40,089 --> 01:09:44,152
Sometimes put a knife in your back
 

918
01:09:44,152 --> 01:09:45,693
and turn it once or twice.
 

919
01:09:47,194 --> 01:09:47,975
Metaphorically.
 

920
01:09:49,556 --> 01:09:52,758
You can't get all hyper about that.
 

921
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:55,080
It happened to Paul.
 

922
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:59,361
It happened to Jesus from what I read in that book.
 

923
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,602
He had one disciple who betrayed him.
 

924
01:10:04,144 --> 01:10:08,487
So don't get all sideways when people act nasty.
 

925
01:10:10,828 --> 01:10:11,989
Jesus said in one place
 

926
01:10:11,989 --> 01:10:14,490
your enemies will come from your own household.
 

927
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:17,472
I have been doing this long enough
 

928
01:10:17,472 --> 01:10:21,235
to counsel people who cry that in their own family
 

929
01:10:21,235 --> 01:10:23,016
they're discouraged to be a Christian.
 

930
01:10:24,497 --> 01:10:27,414
So, But notice what it says here.
 

931
01:10:27,414 --> 01:10:30,895
Demas has forsaken me, not just personal,
 

932
01:10:30,895 --> 01:10:33,216
having loved this present world.
 

933
01:10:33,216 --> 01:10:35,398
So now we're getting the back story.
 

934
01:10:37,218 --> 01:10:41,560
Somehow he got tempted and drawn away by this world.
 

935
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,021
You know, the world is a thing.
 

936
01:10:44,122 --> 01:10:45,082
It's not a globe.
 

937
01:10:45,082 --> 01:10:46,983
It's a spirit, the world.
 

938
01:10:48,764 --> 01:10:53,841
And the Bible says anyone who loves the world can't love God.
 

939
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:54,942
If you want to fit in
 

940
01:10:54,942 --> 01:10:56,563
and be hip and know who's hot
 

941
01:10:56,563 --> 01:10:59,905
and who's not and just kind of flow with everyone here
 

942
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:01,607
even though they hate Jesus
 

943
01:11:01,607 --> 01:11:02,647
you can't love God.
 

944
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:04,869
No, no, no, no.
 

945
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:07,071
You can't serve two masters.
 

946
01:11:07,071 --> 01:11:09,552
Listen to what John says in 1 John.
 

947
01:11:09,552 --> 01:11:13,459
John says, do not love the world.
 

948
01:11:13,459 --> 01:11:14,900
or anything in the world.
 

949
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,641
If anyone loves the world
 

950
01:11:16,641 --> 01:11:18,222
love for the Father is not in them.
 

951
01:11:18,222 --> 01:11:19,723
And that's important now
 

952
01:11:19,723 --> 01:11:22,305
because in the church of Jesus Christ in America
 

953
01:11:22,305 --> 01:11:24,806
instead of us evangelizing the world
 

954
01:11:24,806 --> 01:11:27,088
and making them change and follow Christ
 

955
01:11:27,088 --> 01:11:29,349
the world has evangelized us
 

956
01:11:29,349 --> 01:11:31,731
and brought the church out into the world so
 

957
01:11:31,731 --> 01:11:35,333
that the people know more about the world than they know about God.
 

958
01:11:36,534 --> 01:11:40,557
They know more about whatever than they do the Bible.
 

959
01:11:42,316 --> 01:11:43,617
They know more about movies
 

960
01:11:43,617 --> 01:11:46,300
or sports than they knew about the Apostle Paul.
 

961
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,360
But when trouble comes
 

962
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,642
that other stuff won't help you.
 

963
01:11:49,642 --> 01:11:50,904
You need to be grounded
 

964
01:11:50,904 --> 01:11:53,286
and rooted in the Word of God.
 

965
01:11:53,286 --> 01:11:54,847
Come on, say amen to that.
 

966
01:11:54,847 --> 01:11:55,528
That's the truth.
 

967
01:11:56,529 --> 01:12:01,753
So, for everything in the world
 

968
01:12:01,753 --> 01:12:02,514
what's in the world?
 

969
01:12:02,514 --> 01:12:03,815
What's the world made up of?
 

970
01:12:03,815 --> 01:12:04,976
The lust of the flesh.
 

971
01:12:06,257 --> 01:12:08,179
Look at the advertising for a car.
 

972
01:12:10,732 --> 01:12:15,514
They don't have a 75-year-old Dominican guy with a cane.
 

973
01:12:15,514 --> 01:12:16,615
Buy this car.
 

974
01:12:16,615 --> 01:12:17,676
I really like it.
 

975
01:12:17,676 --> 01:12:18,516
No, no.
 

976
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,338
They got a blonde lady about 23 years old.
 

977
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:24,399
Am I correct or not?
 

978
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,420
And you're looking not at the car.
 

979
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,922
You're looking at something else, too.
 

980
01:12:29,922 --> 01:12:32,683
Because they know exactly how the lust of the flesh work.
 

981
01:12:34,724 --> 01:12:37,094
So it's the lust of the flesh.
 

982
01:12:37,094 --> 01:12:38,334
The lust of the eyes
 

983
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:39,395
I want more and more.
 

984
01:12:39,395 --> 01:12:41,255
Why should she have that and not me?
 

985
01:12:41,255 --> 01:12:41,995
I want it.
 

986
01:12:41,995 --> 01:12:43,536
And the pride of life
 

987
01:12:43,536 --> 01:12:45,876
showing off who you are and what you have.
 

988
01:12:45,876 --> 01:12:47,356
That's what the world is.
 

989
01:12:47,356 --> 01:12:51,217
Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,
 

990
01:12:51,217 --> 01:12:53,598
strutting around, look at me, I am somebody.
 

991
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:59,959
All of that comes not from the Father, but from the world.
 

992
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:02,480
And Demas got hooked by the world.
 

993
01:13:04,529 --> 01:13:05,850
You know, it's like crack.
 

994
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:08,571
Crack addict will tell you it has a voice.
 

995
01:13:08,571 --> 01:13:09,572
It's going to call you.
 

996
01:13:09,572 --> 01:13:13,034
That's what an addict told me once.
 

997
01:13:13,034 --> 01:13:16,236
Pastor, it's not when it calls you, you're coming.
 

998
01:13:16,236 --> 01:13:18,977
It's just how do you get the money for it?
 

999
01:13:18,977 --> 01:13:21,519
It's not the question of you're going to say no to it.
 

1000
01:13:21,519 --> 01:13:23,120
You can't say no to it.
 

1001
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:23,680
It's in you.
 

1002
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,282
And that's the way the world can be.
 

1003
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:32,085
It calls us back to that old way of living, the lust of the flesh,
 

1004
01:13:32,085 --> 01:13:33,525
the lust.
 

1005
01:13:33,525 --> 01:13:37,107
of the eyes and the pride of life.
 

1006
01:13:37,107 --> 01:13:39,848
How many have decided to follow Jesus?
 

1007
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:40,989
No turning back.
 

1008
01:13:40,989 --> 01:13:42,490
Come on, lift your hand.
 

1009
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:43,250
Wave it at me.
 

1010
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,271
No turning back.
 

1011
01:13:44,271 --> 01:13:45,552
We're not turning back.
 

1012
01:13:45,552 --> 01:13:46,552
By the grace of God
 

1013
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:48,213
we're not turning back.
 

1014
01:13:48,213 --> 01:13:49,494
Is that world out there?
 

1015
01:13:49,494 --> 01:13:50,434
Is it attractive?
 

1016
01:13:50,434 --> 01:13:52,595
Does it have a pull?
 

1017
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:53,396
Absolutely.
 

1018
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:55,477
Don't lie and say it doesn't.
 

1019
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:58,539
But I have decided to follow Jesus.
 

1020
01:13:59,599 --> 01:14:03,833
So we learn that there will be people, ministers
 

1021
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:07,317
I had minister friends who are no longer not in the ministry.
 

1022
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:09,660
They've come out and now they're full blown
 

1023
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:12,262
in another lifestyle and boasting about it.
 

1024
01:14:12,262 --> 01:14:13,804
And they used to preach the word of God.
 

1025
01:14:13,804 --> 01:14:17,328
And when I was a younger minister, I said
 

1026
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:20,692
what's going on there?
 

1027
01:14:20,692 --> 01:14:21,573
How did that happen?
 

1028
01:14:22,934 --> 01:14:23,695
It's going to happen.
 

1029
01:14:25,029 --> 01:14:27,090
Don't get excited by it.
 

1030
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:28,090
We weep over it.
 

1031
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,551
We can pray for the person.
 

1032
01:14:29,551 --> 01:14:30,731
But don't go crazy.
 

1033
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:32,532
What is going on?
 

1034
01:14:32,532 --> 01:14:33,492
It happened to Paul.
 

1035
01:14:33,492 --> 01:14:37,133
Paul said, look, I'm writing this in scripture to Timothy.
 

1036
01:14:37,133 --> 01:14:39,794
So you'll know Demas has forsaken me.
 

1037
01:14:39,794 --> 01:14:41,355
People will disappoint you.
 

1038
01:14:41,355 --> 01:14:42,995
And some are going to jump out of the boat
 

1039
01:14:42,995 --> 01:14:44,456
before we get to the other side.
 

1040
01:14:44,456 --> 01:14:47,977
I mean, they're still going to serve him and follow him.
 

1041
01:14:47,977 --> 01:14:48,637
Say amen.
 

1042
01:14:49,798 --> 01:14:51,118
So that's a good lesson for us.
 

1043
01:14:52,379 --> 01:14:53,299
Now there's another one.
 

1044
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:56,771
Maybe, sister, you could find that one
 

1045
01:14:56,771 --> 01:14:58,613
with Alexander the metal worker.
 

1046
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:03,877
We go back to Timothy, 2 Timothy, and it says
 

1047
01:15:05,718 --> 01:15:08,440
Alexander the metal worker, thank you
 

1048
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,261
did me a great deal of harm.
 

1049
01:15:11,522 --> 01:15:13,604
The Lord will repay him for what he has done.
 

1050
01:15:13,604 --> 01:15:14,164
Just hold that.
 

1051
01:15:15,374 --> 01:15:17,676
Paul says, I'm working for the Lord.
 

1052
01:15:17,676 --> 01:15:18,777
I'm serving Christ.
 

1053
01:15:18,777 --> 01:15:20,018
I'm anointed.
 

1054
01:15:20,018 --> 01:15:22,681
I'm so anointed I'm writing part of the New Testament.
 

1055
01:15:22,681 --> 01:15:26,344
And yet God permits Alexander the metal worker
 

1056
01:15:26,344 --> 01:15:28,306
to come up and really mess me up.
 

1057
01:15:30,268 --> 01:15:32,590
When I was growing up, I was taught, no, praise God
 

1058
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:33,631
we have the victory.
 

1059
01:15:33,631 --> 01:15:34,632
Nobody can touch us.
 

1060
01:15:34,632 --> 01:15:35,873
Touch not my anointed.
 

1061
01:15:35,873 --> 01:15:37,515
Do my prophets no harm.
 

1062
01:15:37,515 --> 01:15:40,017
Well, Alexander the metal worker did him a lot of harm.
 

1063
01:15:41,264 --> 01:15:43,886
So you got to get your Christianity according to the Bible,
 

1064
01:15:43,886 --> 01:15:47,808
not American adventurism.
 

1065
01:15:50,649 --> 01:15:53,451
See, life is real when you're a Christian.
 

1066
01:15:53,451 --> 01:15:56,533
Paul lets us know that whatever you go through
 

1067
01:15:56,533 --> 01:15:58,674
he's been through, and then some.
 

1068
01:15:58,674 --> 01:16:00,555
Alexander, the metal worker
 

1069
01:16:00,555 --> 01:16:04,557
did me a lot of harm.
 

1070
01:16:06,018 --> 01:16:08,588
The Lord will repay him for what he has done.
 

1071
01:16:08,588 --> 01:16:10,350
So now here's a question.
 

1072
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:14,095
If you're anointed and you're serving God and you're a Christian
 

1073
01:16:14,095 --> 01:16:16,798
why would God permit somebody to come and hurt you?
 

1074
01:16:16,798 --> 01:16:19,661
Because that's the way life works.
 

1075
01:16:19,661 --> 01:16:20,983
If we suffer with him
 

1076
01:16:20,983 --> 01:16:22,664
we will reign with him.
 

1077
01:16:22,664 --> 01:16:25,928
Do you get it?
 

1078
01:16:25,928 --> 01:16:28,917
To be a Christian doesn't mean you're trouble free.
 

1079
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,539
Come on, do I get a witness here from people?
 

1080
01:16:31,539 --> 01:16:32,580
I want you to know this
 

1081
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:35,382
because there's a lot of, ask Phillips, Craig and Dean.
 

1082
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,624
In fact, some of them live out there
 

1083
01:16:36,624 --> 01:16:38,505
where a lot of these charlatans are.
 

1084
01:16:38,505 --> 01:16:40,046
That if you serve God
 

1085
01:16:40,046 --> 01:16:42,709
and speak the word and confess the faith
 

1086
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:44,150
you'll have no problems
 

1087
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:46,712
and you'll drive a Mercedes at all time.
 

1088
01:16:46,712 --> 01:16:48,313
What do you got that pickup truck for?
 

1089
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:49,254
Get out of that
 

1090
01:16:49,254 --> 01:16:51,276
get in that Mercedes that God has.
 

1091
01:16:51,276 --> 01:16:52,957
You're one of the king's kids
 

1092
01:16:52,957 --> 01:16:54,959
and you will walk and never have a need
 

1093
01:16:54,959 --> 01:16:56,160
and that's all a lie.
 

1094
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:59,191
God does bring blessings.
 

1095
01:16:59,191 --> 01:17:00,952
How many say amen?
 

1096
01:17:00,952 --> 01:17:04,154
But God permits enough trouble that we need to keep holding on to.
 

1097
01:17:05,335 --> 01:17:08,717
Alexander the metal worker did a number on me.
 

1098
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,038
He did me great harm.
 

1099
01:17:12,459 --> 01:17:13,660
So in the Christian life
 

1100
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:15,401
here's a tip for you.
 

1101
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:18,403
There were people not only would disappoint you, turn on you.
 

1102
01:17:18,403 --> 01:17:20,544
Some people would be sent.
 

1103
01:17:20,544 --> 01:17:24,407
Alexander the metal worker was never a believer that we know of.
 

1104
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:26,388
They're just going to come to attack you.
 

1105
01:17:28,695 --> 01:17:29,535
And you can't say
 

1106
01:17:29,535 --> 01:17:31,756
there must be sin in my life.
 

1107
01:17:31,756 --> 01:17:33,276
Where's my faith?
 

1108
01:17:33,276 --> 01:17:35,277
It's part of the journey, my friend.
 

1109
01:17:36,497 --> 01:17:37,877
Like when I was a midshipman
 

1110
01:17:37,877 --> 01:17:40,858
they could break into my door, open that door.
 

1111
01:17:40,858 --> 01:17:42,719
I'd have to stand at attention.
 

1112
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,160
One guy didn't like anyone from New York City.
 

1113
01:17:49,961 --> 01:17:52,257
And he found out where I was from.
 

1114
01:17:52,257 --> 01:17:53,978
And made me stand in front of the mirror
 

1115
01:17:53,978 --> 01:17:57,061
and a hundred times look in the mirror and say, I am ugly.
 

1116
01:17:57,061 --> 01:17:58,141
I am from Brooklyn.
 

1117
01:17:58,141 --> 01:17:58,822
I am ugly.
 

1118
01:17:58,822 --> 01:18:00,123
I am from Brooklyn.
 

1119
01:18:00,123 --> 01:18:00,743
I am ugly.
 

1120
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:01,964
I am from Brooklyn.
 

1121
01:18:01,964 --> 01:18:02,785
And he just sat there
 

1122
01:18:02,785 --> 01:18:04,126
and listened to me say it.
 

1123
01:18:04,126 --> 01:18:05,427
After about 50, he left
 

1124
01:18:05,427 --> 01:18:06,227
but he told me
 

1125
01:18:06,227 --> 01:18:07,308
you better keep saying that.
 

1126
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:08,489
I'll hear you from the hallway.
 

1127
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:12,011
Well, he shouldn't be able to do that.
 

1128
01:18:12,011 --> 01:18:13,352
He could.
 

1129
01:18:13,352 --> 01:18:13,853
And he did.
 

1130
01:18:13,853 --> 01:18:15,574
And that's the way life is.
 

1131
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:22,351
And if you're a little snowflake that doesn't want any trouble
 

1132
01:18:22,351 --> 01:18:23,392
you can't be a Christian.
 

1133
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:28,253
Men are born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.
 

1134
01:18:28,253 --> 01:18:29,914
Show me one person in the Bible,
 

1135
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:32,055
in the New Testament or in the Old Testament
 

1136
01:18:32,055 --> 01:18:34,056
who didn't go through trouble.
 

1137
01:18:34,056 --> 01:18:34,916
Show me one.
 

1138
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:38,057
I'll be happy to be converted to your position.
 

1139
01:18:38,057 --> 01:18:40,738
Moses, his own people tried to kill him.
 

1140
01:18:40,738 --> 01:18:41,698
They were going to stone him.
 

1141
01:18:43,179 --> 01:18:47,057
Jeremiah got thrown in a jail of sorts.
 

1142
01:18:47,057 --> 01:18:48,938
The prophets were all persecuted.
 

1143
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:52,261
When you stand for God
 

1144
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:53,662
as the New Testament says
 

1145
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:56,544
those who live godly lives will suffer much affliction
 

1146
01:18:56,544 --> 01:18:57,845
and persecution.
 

1147
01:18:57,845 --> 01:18:59,186
If you want to fit in with the world
 

1148
01:18:59,186 --> 01:19:00,867
you'll get a little bit less.
 

1149
01:19:00,867 --> 01:19:02,888
But if you really stand for the Lord
 

1150
01:19:02,888 --> 01:19:03,909
they're going to come for you.
 

1151
01:19:03,909 --> 01:19:08,960
They can pick up the scent that you belong to Jesus.
 

1152
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,241
Jesus said it this way.
 

1153
01:19:10,241 --> 01:19:11,343
If they hated me
 

1154
01:19:11,343 --> 01:19:12,824
they're going to hate you.
 

1155
01:19:12,824 --> 01:19:14,446
I know this is different for some of you
 

1156
01:19:14,446 --> 01:19:17,189
but bear with me watching and check your Bible.
 

1157
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:19,391
You'll find I'm speaking truth.
 

1158
01:19:19,391 --> 01:19:20,332
If they hated me
 

1159
01:19:20,332 --> 01:19:21,273
they'll hate you.
 

1160
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:22,794
If they persecuted me
 

1161
01:19:22,794 --> 01:19:24,336
they will persecute you.
 

1162
01:19:24,336 --> 01:19:26,478
No servant can be greater than his master.
 

1163
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,601
But if we suffer with him
 

1164
01:19:30,863 --> 01:19:32,224
we will reign with him.
 

1165
01:19:33,321 --> 01:19:35,022
In 2 Corinthians, wait
 

1166
01:19:35,022 --> 01:19:37,322
in 2 Corinthians 11 and 12
 

1167
01:19:37,322 --> 01:19:42,724
Paul gives a list of all the stuff he went through as an apostle.
 

1168
01:19:43,804 --> 01:19:46,125
And he talks about outwardly we're decaying
 

1169
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:48,485
but inwardly we're getting renewed every day.
 

1170
01:19:48,485 --> 01:19:49,506
But he said, oh, man
 

1171
01:19:49,506 --> 01:19:55,047
I've been beat three times, 39 lashes
 

1172
01:19:55,047 --> 01:20:00,469
I think it was, thrown in the open sea, spent a day in the open deep.
 

1173
01:20:01,765 --> 01:20:04,526
in trouble in the cities in trouble in the country
 

1174
01:20:04,526 --> 01:20:07,508
thrown in prison stoned flogged
 

1175
01:20:08,828 --> 01:20:11,389
suffer hunger i know it is to suffer thirst
 

1176
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:14,291
well where's your anointing
 

1177
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:15,531
no don't you get it brothers
 

1178
01:20:15,531 --> 01:20:18,512
and sisters i want you to have real christianity
 

1179
01:20:18,512 --> 01:20:22,774
not american christianity i don't want perversions of the scripture
 

1180
01:20:22,774 --> 01:20:24,135
i want to know the truth
 

1181
01:20:24,135 --> 01:20:26,536
because the truth will set us free
 

1182
01:20:26,536 --> 01:20:31,218
listen there's trouble in life that's why that other place is called
 

1183
01:20:33,826 --> 01:20:35,527
Where there's no more tears.
 

1184
01:20:36,668 --> 01:20:37,829
But here on earth
 

1185
01:20:37,829 --> 01:20:38,670
there's some tears.
 

1186
01:20:40,271 --> 01:20:42,693
How many have ever been attacked by someone
 

1187
01:20:42,693 --> 01:20:45,655
and they're out to hurt you in life in one way, shape or form?
 

1188
01:20:45,655 --> 01:20:46,776
Just lift your hand, right?
 

1189
01:20:48,017 --> 01:20:49,719
It wasn't because you weren't a Christian.
 

1190
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:52,341
Sometimes it's because you are a Christian.
 

1191
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:56,757
So Paul says these things to Timothy.
 

1192
01:20:56,757 --> 01:20:58,717
God puts it in the New Testament.
 

1193
01:20:58,717 --> 01:21:00,318
So we've learned the real deal.
 

1194
01:21:00,318 --> 01:21:02,458
Instead of just triumphalism
 

1195
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:05,039
shouting God is good bump all the time.
 

1196
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:08,920
He is good all the time.
 

1197
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:11,761
But you go through some trouble down here.
 

1198
01:21:12,941 --> 01:21:14,702
And if you're going through some trouble today
 

1199
01:21:14,702 --> 01:21:15,482
lift up your head.
 

1200
01:21:16,702 --> 01:21:18,203
Your redemption is drawing nigh.
 

1201
01:21:19,343 --> 01:21:21,503
Don't get all discombobulated by it.
 

1202
01:21:21,503 --> 01:21:22,444
It's not over.
 

1203
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:23,344
It's not over.
 

1204
01:21:24,537 --> 01:21:25,718
Don't give up.
 

1205
01:21:25,718 --> 01:21:27,699
God is still there.
 

1206
01:21:27,699 --> 01:21:30,141
But there's Demases who will disappoint you,
 

1207
01:21:30,141 --> 01:21:32,583
having loved this present world.
 

1208
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:34,924
And there's also Alexander the metal worker.
 

1209
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:35,985
But notice this.
 

1210
01:21:35,985 --> 01:21:37,646
This is a key.
 

1211
01:21:37,646 --> 01:21:40,648
May the Lord repay him for what he's done.
 

1212
01:21:40,648 --> 01:21:45,672
The temptation with Alexander the metal worker is this.
 

1213
01:21:45,672 --> 01:21:46,892
They get inside your craw.
 

1214
01:21:48,397 --> 01:21:51,680
And you get bitter because they're so nasty.
 

1215
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,601
And now you're a double loser.
 

1216
01:21:53,601 --> 01:21:55,042
I'm a double loser.
 

1217
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:56,724
They not only hurt me
 

1218
01:21:56,724 --> 01:22:00,687
now I got bitterness inside of me which poisons my own spirit.
 

1219
01:22:02,068 --> 01:22:03,950
May the Lord take care of them.
 

1220
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:08,053
The Lord's going to take care of Alexander the metal worker.
 

1221
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:10,455
No, come on, Pastor Simba, come on
 

1222
01:22:10,455 --> 01:22:12,457
let's get Alexander the metal worker.
 

1223
01:22:12,457 --> 01:22:13,898
We're fighting cultural wars.
 

1224
01:22:13,898 --> 01:22:16,300
We're going to kill everyone who disagrees with us.
 

1225
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,781
That is not the spirit of Jesus.
 

1226
01:22:18,988 --> 01:22:21,490
Let the Lord take care of people.
 

1227
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:23,412
How many want the Lord to take care of people?
 

1228
01:22:23,412 --> 01:22:25,194
Come on, wave your hand at me.
 

1229
01:22:25,194 --> 01:22:26,835
Those who are against you
 

1230
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:27,816
let the Lord do it.
 

1231
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:31,620
He does it, if you would come, in such a better way than us.
 

1232
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:37,005
You've heard me refer to this from the Old Testament.
 

1233
01:22:37,005 --> 01:22:40,388
Moses marries a black woman.
 

1234
01:22:41,469 --> 01:22:42,330
And even back then
 

1235
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:44,252
a lot of people were sideways with race.
 

1236
01:22:45,363 --> 01:22:50,425
And he marries a black woman, probably from Ethiopia, Kushite.
 

1237
01:22:50,425 --> 01:22:53,946
And his brother and his sister
 

1238
01:22:53,946 --> 01:22:55,567
who's the high priest, and Miriam
 

1239
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:56,987
who let everyone out dancing
 

1240
01:22:58,368 --> 01:22:59,528
they don't like it.
 

1241
01:22:59,528 --> 01:23:01,729
So they get up at his grill.
 

1242
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:02,529
What are you doing?
 

1243
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,310
You're not the only one anointed.
 

1244
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:08,171
You have no business marrying that woman.
 

1245
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:09,472
We didn't approve.
 

1246
01:23:09,472 --> 01:23:11,692
By the way, just a side note.
 

1247
01:23:11,692 --> 01:23:14,105
When someone is dating someone else
 

1248
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:16,086
Don't give your opinion
 

1249
01:23:16,086 --> 01:23:17,606
because it's none of your business.
 

1250
01:23:19,507 --> 01:23:21,007
Listen, listen, listen again.
 

1251
01:23:23,568 --> 01:23:25,808
When someone seems to be going out with someone
 

1252
01:23:25,808 --> 01:23:27,849
and they might get married
 

1253
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:29,709
why do you have to have an opinion of that?
 

1254
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:31,950
Are you God?
 

1255
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:34,051
Are you Solomon?
 

1256
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,291
Are you the wisest person?
 

1257
01:23:36,291 --> 01:23:39,052
It says in Philippians, in the NLT
 

1258
01:23:39,052 --> 01:23:42,113
mind your own business.
 

1259
01:23:45,671 --> 01:23:46,712
They did not.
 

1260
01:23:46,712 --> 01:23:48,472
They got into it with Moses.
 

1261
01:23:48,472 --> 01:23:49,693
And you know what Moses did?
 

1262
01:23:49,693 --> 01:23:51,354
This is the worst thing that can happen.
 

1263
01:23:51,354 --> 01:23:53,535
This is what Paul is doing.
 

1264
01:23:53,535 --> 01:23:55,176
If you're criticizing someone
 

1265
01:23:55,176 --> 01:23:56,497
or they're criticizing you
 

1266
01:23:56,497 --> 01:23:58,177
and you don't fight back
 

1267
01:23:58,177 --> 01:23:59,878
you know what Moses did?
 

1268
01:23:59,878 --> 01:24:00,959
He fell to the ground.
 

1269
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,622
I belong to you, God.
 

1270
01:24:08,323 --> 01:24:09,423
You see what they're saying.
 

1271
01:24:09,423 --> 01:24:11,064
I'm not even going to answer them.
 

1272
01:24:14,452 --> 01:24:16,293
When you fight and attack someone
 

1273
01:24:16,293 --> 01:24:18,013
and they fall to the ground and say, God
 

1274
01:24:18,013 --> 01:24:19,354
take care of me.
 

1275
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:20,134
If I were you
 

1276
01:24:20,134 --> 01:24:23,396
I would get a ticket out of town very quickly
 

1277
01:24:23,396 --> 01:24:25,136
because you're in a very bad place.
 

1278
01:24:26,397 --> 01:24:30,318
And suddenly the cloud moves from above the tabernacle
 

1279
01:24:30,318 --> 01:24:34,440
and it hovers over Miriam and Aaron.
 

1280
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,321
And God speaks and says
 

1281
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:41,123
who are you to talk against my servant Moses?
 

1282
01:24:46,309 --> 01:24:47,229
So here's the thing.
 

1283
01:24:47,229 --> 01:24:48,890
We can fight our own battles
 

1284
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:51,051
or we can let God fight our battles.
 

1285
01:24:51,051 --> 01:24:52,791
How many want God to fight your battles?
 

1286
01:24:52,791 --> 01:24:53,552
Say amen.
 

1287
01:24:54,552 --> 01:24:56,433
So Paul says, yeah, Alexander
 

1288
01:24:56,433 --> 01:24:58,294
the metal worker is a bad dude.
 

1289
01:24:58,294 --> 01:24:59,994
There are evil people out there.
 

1290
01:25:01,135 --> 01:25:03,215
Education isn't going to change people.
 

1291
01:25:04,356 --> 01:25:05,536
Education is helpful.
 

1292
01:25:05,536 --> 01:25:07,817
But the whole liberal idea
 

1293
01:25:07,817 --> 01:25:09,578
that the more you educate people
 

1294
01:25:09,578 --> 01:25:11,098
we're more educated now
 

1295
01:25:11,098 --> 01:25:13,799
than we've ever been in the history of mankind.
 

1296
01:25:13,799 --> 01:25:15,080
And we got more evil going on.
 

1297
01:25:16,619 --> 01:25:18,160
Just make smart, evil people.
 

1298
01:25:22,965 --> 01:25:24,846
So, on the journey
 

1299
01:25:24,846 --> 01:25:30,091
we're going to have Demas forsake us, love the world, jump ship.
 

1300
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:31,332
They're not a Christian anymore.
 

1301
01:25:31,332 --> 01:25:33,253
Okay, I feel bad for you, Demas.
 

1302
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:35,015
I will pray for you.
 

1303
01:25:35,015 --> 01:25:36,877
Turn to Jesus, please, Demas
 

1304
01:25:36,877 --> 01:25:39,499
but I'm going to keep my eyes on the Lord.
 

1305
01:25:42,068 --> 01:25:43,990
They'll be Alexander the metal worker.
 

1306
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,550
They will.
 

1307
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:45,951
There's coming a day
 

1308
01:25:45,951 --> 01:25:47,472
where you'll run into him.
 

1309
01:25:47,472 --> 01:25:48,153
He's everywhere.
 

1310
01:25:48,153 --> 01:25:51,135
In one way or another
 

1311
01:25:51,135 --> 01:25:52,857
he's out to do harm.
 

1312
01:25:52,857 --> 01:25:54,338
Let the Lord take care of it.
 

1313
01:25:54,338 --> 01:25:55,199
But don't get shook up.
 

1314
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:04,747
Lastly, Paul says, at my first trial, everyone deserted me.
 

1315
01:26:06,648 --> 01:26:10,709
And there I was in the court.
 

1316
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:14,251
With not one person standing with me.
 

1317
01:26:14,251 --> 01:26:16,032
All these converts I've made.
 

1318
01:26:16,032 --> 01:26:18,514
All that I've gone through for the ministry.
 

1319
01:26:18,514 --> 01:26:20,415
All the sermons I've preached.
 

1320
01:26:20,415 --> 01:26:22,296
All the letters that I've written.
 

1321
01:26:22,296 --> 01:26:25,018
And here I am in front of the man, the judge
 

1322
01:26:25,018 --> 01:26:26,579
and I got nobody with me.
 

1323
01:26:26,579 --> 01:26:28,340
It reminds me of somebody else.
 

1324
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:31,963
Who does that remind you of?
 

1325
01:26:31,963 --> 01:26:32,383
Jesus.
 

1326
01:26:33,464 --> 01:26:34,484
Sometimes you're all alone.
 

1327
01:26:36,546 --> 01:26:37,766
It shouldn't be that way, you say.
 

1328
01:26:37,766 --> 01:26:39,443
I know, but it is.
 

1329
01:26:39,443 --> 01:26:39,963
They're weak.
 

1330
01:26:39,963 --> 01:26:40,823
They were weak.
 

1331
01:26:40,823 --> 01:26:41,564
Don't you get it?
 

1332
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:43,384
People have fears.
 

1333
01:26:43,384 --> 01:26:45,965
Not maybe everyone is as strong as you.
 

1334
01:26:45,965 --> 01:26:48,265
You got to take into account people's weakness.
 

1335
01:26:48,265 --> 01:26:49,686
Yeah, but they should have been there.
 

1336
01:26:49,686 --> 01:26:51,906
Listen, they weren't there.
 

1337
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:52,586
They were afraid.
 

1338
01:26:52,586 --> 01:26:54,487
Doesn't mean they're not Christians.
 

1339
01:26:54,487 --> 01:26:55,387
They just were afraid.
 

1340
01:26:55,387 --> 01:26:57,988
Not everyone has the same boldness, same faith.
 

1341
01:27:00,108 --> 01:27:03,169
And he said, everyone forsook me.
 

1342
01:27:03,169 --> 01:27:05,490
So here's what I want to leave you with.
 

1343
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:07,350
But the Lord didn't forsake me.
 

1344
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:10,253
He stood by my side.
 

1345
01:27:10,253 --> 01:27:11,694
Nobody could see him but me.
 

1346
01:27:12,835 --> 01:27:13,976
But he was right there.
 

1347
01:27:15,757 --> 01:27:19,479
And he adds this little note, so gracious, so kind.
 

1348
01:27:19,479 --> 01:27:21,621
Everyone forsook me.
 

1349
01:27:21,621 --> 01:27:25,984
May the Lord not account it to their charge.
 

1350
01:27:28,405 --> 01:27:29,826
Right to the end
 

1351
01:27:29,826 --> 01:27:32,328
he's having mercy and patience with people.
 

1352
01:27:33,369 --> 01:27:36,031
Because he has God's spirit within him.
 

1353
01:27:36,031 --> 01:27:38,724
God's spirit doesn't make us vindictive.
 

1354
01:27:38,724 --> 01:27:40,145
We show grace to people.
 

1355
01:27:41,526 --> 01:27:43,607
And the Lord was there.
 

1356
01:27:45,148 --> 01:27:47,030
And he brought me through it.
 

1357
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:49,011
This last word I want to leave you.
 

1358
01:27:49,011 --> 01:27:51,473
Singers, if you would come up here quickly.
 

1359
01:27:51,473 --> 01:27:52,173
He said this.
 

1360
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:56,756
And he delivered me and he's going to continue to deliver me.
 

1361
01:27:56,756 --> 01:27:58,377
So here's my word to you today.
 

1362
01:27:58,377 --> 01:28:03,681
The Lord has had to apply it to me many times in the last few years.
 

1363
01:28:03,681 --> 01:28:07,103
What you're going through is not forever.
 

1364
01:28:07,103 --> 01:28:08,524
It's just a season.
 

1365
01:28:10,172 --> 01:28:12,293
You're going to come out of it.
 

1366
01:28:12,293 --> 01:28:14,374
The Lord is with you in it.
 

1367
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:15,714
And then at the right time
 

1368
01:28:15,714 --> 01:28:17,475
he's going to take you out of it.
 

1369
01:28:18,675 --> 01:28:20,996
But it's not forever.
 

1370
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:24,037
Enemy wants to suggest to us when we have trouble.
 

1371
01:28:24,037 --> 01:28:25,217
See, that's it.
 

1372
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:27,358
That's the end of your life.
 

1373
01:28:27,358 --> 01:28:28,118
He's a liar.
 

1374
01:28:28,118 --> 01:28:29,979
When he speaks, he's lying.
 

1375
01:28:29,979 --> 01:28:31,259
He's the father of lies.
 

1376
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,361
Paul says, no, the Lord brought me through that.
 

1377
01:28:34,361 --> 01:28:36,022
He's looking back now.
 

1378
01:28:36,022 --> 01:28:37,763
Timothy, I want to tell you about that.
 

1379
01:28:37,763 --> 01:28:38,904
I stood in front of the judge.
 

1380
01:28:38,904 --> 01:28:40,365
There was nobody there.
 

1381
01:28:40,365 --> 01:28:43,107
He could have thrown up his hands and said, oh, judge
 

1382
01:28:43,107 --> 01:28:45,008
before you say anything
 

1383
01:28:45,008 --> 01:28:46,209
could I vent a little bit?
 

1384
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:49,492
Yo, where are my supporters?
 

1385
01:28:51,553 --> 01:28:54,915
Have I not done enough for you to help you serve Christ?
 

1386
01:28:54,915 --> 01:28:56,056
No.
 

1387
01:28:56,056 --> 01:28:56,837
He accepted it.
 

1388
01:28:57,938 --> 01:28:59,359
Don't punish them for it, Lord.
 

1389
01:29:00,459 --> 01:29:01,620
But one thing I know
 

1390
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,981
they might forsake me.
 

1391
01:29:02,981 --> 01:29:05,137
You'll never forsake me.
 

1392
01:29:05,137 --> 01:29:06,698
I want to tell you today
 

1393
01:29:06,698 --> 01:29:08,558
the Lord is with you.
 

1394
01:29:08,558 --> 01:29:09,538
I don't feel him.
 

1395
01:29:09,538 --> 01:29:10,459
I know, but he's with you.
 

1396
01:29:12,299 --> 01:29:12,900
Have faith.
 

1397
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:15,020
Forget feelings for a second.
 

1398
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:16,961
The Lord is with you.
 

1399
01:29:16,961 --> 01:29:18,802
He's invisible, but he's with you.
 

1400
01:29:18,802 --> 01:29:21,082
He's going to fight your battles.
 

1401
01:29:21,082 --> 01:29:22,023
You know what you need to do?
 

1402
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:25,304
You need to turn your eyes upon Jesus.
 

1403
01:29:26,404 --> 01:29:28,445
Look full in his wonderful face
 

1404
01:29:28,445 --> 01:29:31,746
and the things of this earth will grow.
 

1405
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:35,909
strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace.
 

1406
01:29:35,909 --> 01:29:37,690
Demases come and go.
 

1407
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:39,371
Alexander the coppersmith,
 

1408
01:29:39,371 --> 01:29:41,752
we're all going to meet characters like that.
 

1409
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:43,572
And sometimes we're going to feel all alone
 

1410
01:29:43,572 --> 01:29:44,693
but you are not alone.
 

1411
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:47,294
Jesus says to us, fear not
 

1412
01:29:48,434 --> 01:29:49,755
I am with you.
 

1413
01:29:49,755 --> 01:29:50,695
Please bow your heads.
 

1414
01:29:53,617 --> 01:29:56,018
Anybody here just going through a demas,
 

1415
01:29:57,198 --> 01:29:59,599
an Alexander the metal worker moment
 

1416
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,661
or just You're going through a season
 

1417
01:30:03,661 --> 01:30:05,202
like you've never had in your life.
 

1418
01:30:05,202 --> 01:30:07,262
And you feel like no one understands.
 

1419
01:30:07,262 --> 01:30:08,743
No one knows.
 

1420
01:30:08,743 --> 01:30:10,924
No one can feel what you're feeling.
 

1421
01:30:10,924 --> 01:30:12,684
You just stand up where you are.
 

1422
01:30:12,684 --> 01:30:14,044
We're going to pray over you.
 

1423
01:30:15,165 --> 01:30:17,666
That God's going to give you a spirit of faith.
 

1424
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:19,946
Just stand up right where you are, Pastor.
 

1425
01:30:19,946 --> 01:30:21,267
That message was for me.
 

1426
01:30:21,267 --> 01:30:23,367
It had my name on it.
 

1427
01:30:23,367 --> 01:30:25,688
How would you possibly know what I was going through?
 

1428
01:30:25,688 --> 01:30:29,389
That was written for our encouragement.
 

1429
01:30:30,627 --> 01:30:32,509
So that when the trials of life come
 

1430
01:30:32,509 --> 01:30:35,694
we won't explode, go sideways, give up,
 

1431
01:30:35,694 --> 01:30:38,497
quit, get bitter, get frustrated.
 

1432
01:30:38,497 --> 01:30:42,182
Oh, God, help us to grow up so
 

1433
01:30:42,182 --> 01:30:44,625
that we can stand firm and strong.
 

1434
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:50,544
While we sing, while this choir sings this song, you just listen.
 

1435
01:30:50,544 --> 01:30:52,406
Anyone else wants prayer
 

1436
01:30:52,406 --> 01:30:53,747
just stand up where you are.
 

1437
01:30:53,747 --> 01:31:06,901
Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
 

1438
01:31:18,143 --> 01:31:20,065
If you're standing, come here to the front.
 

1439
01:31:20,065 --> 01:31:21,026
Come on.
 

1440
01:31:21,026 --> 01:31:23,147
Come on to the front.
 

1441
01:31:23,147 --> 01:31:26,750
Come to the front if you're standing.
 

1442
01:31:28,572 --> 01:31:31,654
Everyone standing, come to the front please.
 

1443
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:32,615
The balcony too.
 

1444
01:31:32,615 --> 01:31:36,118
Everyone sing now.
 

1445
01:31:58,408 --> 01:32:10,714
Looks for it in his wonderful face.
 

1446
01:32:10,714 --> 01:32:24,241
And the deeds of life will grow sweetly there in the light.
 

1447
01:32:32,704 --> 01:32:33,866
If you're here in the front
 

1448
01:32:33,866 --> 01:32:34,907
lift up your hand.
 

1449
01:32:34,907 --> 01:32:36,949
Sing as a testimony now.
 

1450
01:32:36,949 --> 01:32:43,496
Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
 

1451
01:32:43,496 --> 01:32:47,580
Look forward.
 

1452
01:33:23,311 --> 01:33:24,352
Everyone stand.
 

1453
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:27,313
Everyone in the building stand up and sing with us.
 

1454
01:33:27,313 --> 01:33:28,233
Sing.
 

1455
01:33:28,233 --> 01:33:28,434
Turn.
 

1456
01:33:35,271 --> 01:34:24,037
My Jesus My Jesus Lord, I ask you, first, Lord, increase our faith.
 

1457
01:34:25,778 --> 01:34:27,999
We go by feeling and sight too much.
 

1458
01:34:29,255 --> 01:34:30,056
Me included.
 

1459
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:36,441
Give us the maturity that sees the invisible.
 

1460
01:34:36,441 --> 01:34:37,702
That sees eternity.
 

1461
01:34:42,146 --> 01:34:44,267
When those demons moments happen
 

1462
01:34:44,267 --> 01:34:48,231
and we feel stabbed in the back, disappointed.
 

1463
01:34:48,231 --> 01:34:49,151
What's happening?
 

1464
01:34:49,151 --> 01:34:51,333
Look, they're not serving God anymore.
 

1465
01:34:52,914 --> 01:34:55,637
Steady our eyes on you, Lord.
 

1466
01:34:55,637 --> 01:34:56,938
And hold our hands tight.
 

1467
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:02,790
Don't let the enemy win a double victory
 

1468
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:06,612
not only pulling someone away but discouraging us.
 

1469
01:35:09,194 --> 01:35:12,576
When we have our Alexander the Metalworker moments
 

1470
01:35:12,576 --> 01:35:17,900
when some mean demonic person comes to harm our reputation
 

1471
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:24,784
or our name or hurt us financially or just mean
 

1472
01:35:24,784 --> 01:35:26,085
like they were with you, Lord
 

1473
01:35:26,085 --> 01:35:27,246
when they spit on you.
 

1474
01:35:28,299 --> 01:35:31,080
and cursed you, hung you on a tree.
 

1475
01:35:32,641 --> 01:35:34,361
Help us to have the spirit of Jesus.
 

1476
01:35:36,302 --> 01:35:39,703
Help us not to fight back and get mean ourselves
 

1477
01:35:39,703 --> 01:35:42,564
but help us to leave it with you, God.
 

1478
01:35:42,564 --> 01:35:44,425
Fight our battles, Lord.
 

1479
01:35:44,425 --> 01:35:45,585
In the name of Jesus
 

1480
01:35:45,585 --> 01:35:47,486
we give you our battles today.
 

1481
01:35:47,486 --> 01:35:49,567
Fight the battles for us today, Lord.
 

1482
01:35:50,827 --> 01:35:52,048
Vindicate your servants.
 

1483
01:35:54,189 --> 01:35:58,209
And finally, Lord, when it seems like no one understands
 

1484
01:35:58,209 --> 01:35:59,050
No one's around.
 

1485
01:36:02,312 --> 01:36:05,374
Just the way you held the Apostle Paul up, hold us up.
 

1486
01:36:08,336 --> 01:36:10,878
Make your presence and closeness known to us.
 

1487
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,002
No one ever cared for me like Jesus.
 

1488
01:36:18,783 --> 01:36:20,164
Help us to sing that song.
 

1489
01:36:21,865 --> 01:36:23,206
And it's only a season.
 

1490
01:36:24,647 --> 01:36:26,248
What we're going through is only a season.
 

1491
01:36:26,248 --> 01:36:27,008
It's not forever.
 

1492
01:36:27,008 --> 01:36:27,849
Heaven is forever.
 

1493
01:36:28,979 --> 01:36:30,680
What we're going through now is just a little
 

1494
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:34,382
it's not even worthy to compare with what's waiting for us.
 

1495
01:36:36,683 --> 01:36:38,444
Make us strong, mature Christians.
 

1496
01:36:39,985 --> 01:36:42,066
Someone here, Lord, and is not a Christian.
 

1497
01:36:44,127 --> 01:36:47,109
I pray that they will repent of their sins
 

1498
01:36:47,109 --> 01:36:49,250
and put their faith in Jesus Christ.
 

1499
01:36:52,031 --> 01:36:54,313
But for the rest of us, Lord
 

1500
01:36:54,313 --> 01:36:56,334
we lift up a hand and we sing.
 

1501
01:36:56,334 --> 01:36:57,855
Come on, sing with me.
 

1502
01:36:57,855 --> 01:36:59,116
Lift your hand.
 

1503
01:36:59,116 --> 01:37:05,818
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
 

1504
01:37:05,818 --> 01:37:15,221
who was born in His wonderful face,
 

1505
01:37:15,221 --> 01:37:44,010
and the peace In the light of His lovely light.
